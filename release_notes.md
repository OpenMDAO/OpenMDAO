# Release Notes for OpenMDAO 3.3.0

September 04, 2020

OpenMDAO 3.3.0 features some changes to the setup/configure stack that
are intended to make it easier to implement complex models in OpenMDAO.

The new group method `get_io_metadata` is available from the `configure`
method of Groups.  During setup, a Group's configure method is run
after the setup methods of all children have been run.
The `get_io_metadata` method allows one to inquire about the inputs and outputs
within the Group and its descendents.  For instance, it can be used to find the names,
units, and shapes of inputs and outputs in the descendent components of a Group.

A new Differential Evolution driver has been added.
This driver is for use on problems with continuous design variables,
and is roughly 3x faster than the existing Simple GA Driver.

## Backwards Incompatible API Changes:

- list_outputs will now return the system-relative promoted path of outputs
- list_inputs will now return the system-relative absolute path of inputs

## Backwards Incompatible NON-API Changes:

None

## New Features:

- Added more information to the node info window in the n2. #1610
- Removed warning when recording deprecated options in viewer data. #1613
- <POEM 029> Adds get_io_metadata method to retrieve metadata of underlying inputs and outputs. #1618
- Internal definition of undefined inputs is now managed with an _UNDEFINED constant in openmdao.core.constants. #1622
- N2 code getting tree dict updated to use _UNDEFINED constant. #1623
- When encountering an AnalysisError, drivers will now indicate which component raised the error. #1650
- Differential Evolution driver added. #1662
- <POEM 031> Added Aitken Relaxation to the Linear Block Gauss-Seidel solver. #1663
- Tagging capability added to AddSubtractComp #1664

## Bug Fixes:

- Fix for a bug where design variables declared in a subsystem are not set up correctly. #1604

- Fixed mistake in error message: set_input_defaults expects keyword val not value. #1638
- Fix for unserializable object failure when running n2. #1639
- Fix for typo in handling of flat_src_indices. #1642

# Release Notes for OpenMDAO 3.2.1

August 07, 2020

OpenMDAO 3.2.1 is a minor update intended to address issues introduced in 3.2.0.

On the user-facing side, there are continuing improvements to the N2 visualization tool.
Version 3.2.0 introduced the ability to use `om.slicer` to specify indices and src_indices via slices.  This update now allows the Ellipsis (`...`) in the specification of slices, which should make connecting subsets of multidimensional outputs much simpler.
Nonlinear solvers also now have the ability to detect stalls.

## Backwards Incompatible API Changes:

- Removed unused args from IndepVarComp.add_output #1576

## Backwards Incompatible NON-API Changes:


## New Features:

- Pinned N2 arrows are now transitioned between updates #1563
- Update vector API to eliminate the need to access internal vector data structures directly. This is a good idea in general but is mandatory for nocopy transfers, where the internal '_data' array in input vectors no longer contains storage for all of the variables. #1567
- Support for ellipsis objects in om.Slicer #1564
- Added Stall Detection to the nonlinear solvers. #1574

## Bug Fixes:

- Reworked error/warning behavior for set_input_defaults so that ambiguities resolved at a higher level trigger a warning instead of an error. #1568
- The N2 code and several areas of the docs still referenced param/unknown terms instead of input/output. These were updated, and a few other areas of N2 code were cleaned up as well. #1570
- An error message is now raised if set_val is called before setup. #1578
- Calls made to set_input_defaults inside of the configure method are no longer ignored. #1583
- When multiple inputs promoted to the same name were explicitly connected to an output, a units ambiguity error was generated even if all of the inputs had the same units. #1587
- Fixed bug in directional derivatives of implicit states when checking partials on a matrix-free component. #1589
- Allow BalanceComp I/O to be sized from rhs_val if val is unavailable #1591
- Fixed bug in group promotes with input src_indices being ignored. #1595

## Miscellaneous:

- Multiple versions of the TLDR Paraboloid example were consolidated #1555
- Fix for test failure on AppVeyor. Compare against Numpy integer datatype. #1586

# Release Notes for OpenMDAO 3.2.0

July 21, 2020

OpenMDAO 3.2.0 introduces significant changes in the way OpenMDAO works.
The primary change is that the manual creation of IndepVarComp outputs is no longer required because OpenMDAO will create them for you in the background.
This was done in a backwards compatible way so that old models will still run and you can still use IndepVarComps if you want to.
However, in the vast majority of cases, you don't need to manually create either the IndepVarComp component or add outputs to it anymore.

This feature aids in creating modular systems. Previously, there was always debate as to whether a system should "own" its own IndepVarComp.
Doing so, however, meant that the outputs of that IVC couldn't be passed in externally without changing the system.
This is no longer the case.
Now any inputs that remain unconnected at the end of the problem setup sequence will be connected to special automatic IndepVarComp outputs that are addressable using the pathname of the inputs.
We have updated the docs to use the new style where IndepVarComps are not manually created. We now consider it best practice not to manually create IndepVarComps in the vast majority of cases.

Another new feature is the openmdao.api.slicer which helps specify src_indices for connections or indices for design variables, objectives, and constraints.
This is intended to allow the user to easily connect portions of an output to an input (such as selecting an individual column from a matrix, for instance).
The old method of providing an explicit list of indices should still work. However, the new slicer gives greater functionality since it allows for the use of general slicing syntax such as `om.slicer[0:10:1, :]`.
Using the slicer object is now considered the new best coding practice for giving src_indices or indices arguments.

We hope these changes will reduce the development burden on our users.
As this is a significant change, some issues may have slipped through our testing, and any feedback is always welcomed via issues on the GitHub repository.

## Backwards Incompatible API Changes:

- Fix a typo in user_terminate_signal option, deprecated the old. #1469
- Remove support for factorial function in ExecComp. #1483

## Backwards Incompatible NON-API Changes:

- _all_subsystem_iter has been removed.  Users should use the systems_iter method instead.

## New Features:

- N2 viewer changes to improve performance. #1475
- Local table of contents (navigation) added to docs sidebar. #1477
- N2 now uses coloring info by default to show dependence in each component. #1478
- Added test to capture error message when running in parallel with non distributed components. #1484
- N2 adds a spinner to give the user an indication when it isn't finished rendering. #1485
- All case recorder files now always contain system options information about all systems in the model. #1486
- Model data now compressed when saved in N2 HTML file. #1490
- Added support for om.slicer as a way to pass in slices to src_indices/indices arguments in add_design_var, add_response, add_constraint, promotes, and connect. #1491
- Added flag for `under_approx` to let the user know when a system is operating under any derivative approximation scheme, and a new counter `iter_count_without_approx`. #1492
- Allow the linear algebra components (DotProductComp, CrossProductComp, MatrixVectorProductComp, VectorMagnitudeComp) to each perform multiple calculations. #1503
- Automatically add a single, user-hidden, top-level IndepVarComp to provide outputs for every unconnected input in the model. #1539

## Bug Fixes:

- Fix bug where exception was raised while printing bounds violations via "print_bound_enforce" option on linesearch if one side of an output was unbounded. #1466
- Fixed an exception when using AddSubtractComp constructor instead of its add_equation method. #1474
- Minor fixes for Appveyor CI. #1495
- IndepVarComp did not use the options mechanism like other Components, which was an issue for a user that wanted to subclass it with additional options. #1536
- Problem.record() provides a useful error message if called before final_setup. #1545
- Fixed a bug that was obliterating options passed to BalanceComp, and added tests for better coverage. #1546
- Added quotes to install command in docs to prevent problems in some shell environments. #1547

# Release Notes for OpenMDAO 3.0.0

March 05, 2020

OpenMDAO 3.0.0 is the first version of OpenMDAO to drop support for Python 2.7.  Going forward,
we will support Python >= 3.6.  Functionally, 3.0.0 is identical to 2.10.1 with the exception
that long-standing deprecations have been removed and will now result in errors.

When upgrading to OpenMDAO 3.0.0, users should
1. Get their models working with version 2.10.1
2. Make necessary changes to remove any OpenMDAO-specific deprecation warnings
3. Upgrade to OpenMDAO 3.0.0 and verify that their models are working as expected.


## Backwards Incompatible API Changes:

The following are deprecated functionality since 2.0 that has been officially removed as of version 3.0.0:

- <POEM 004> AkimaSplineComp and BsplineComp have been **removed**, replaced with SplineComp.

- <POEM 008> The user is now **required** to set a value for the solver option `solve_subsystems`
    on Newton and Broyden solvers. Previously the default was `False`, but you would get
    a deprecation warning if this value was not explicitly set.

- The class for the PETSc linear solver `PetscKSP` is renamed `PetscKrylov`.

- The class for the Scipy linear solver `ScipyIterativeSolver` is renamed `ScipyKrylov`.

- The `NonLinearRunOnce` solver is now `NonlinearRunOnce`.

- The `FloatKrigingSurrogate` is now `KrigingSurrogate`.

- Optimizer `ScipyOptimizer` is now `ScipyOptimizeDriver`.

- API function and CLI command `view_model` are renamed `n2`.

- Component `ExternalCode` is renamed `ExternalCodeComp`.

- Component `KSComponent` is renamed `KSComp`.

- Component `MetaModelStructured` is renamed `MetaModelStructuredComp`.

- Component `MetaModel` is renamed `MetaModelUnStructuredComp`.

- Component `MultiFiMetaModel` is renamed `MultiFiMetaModelUnStructuredComp`.

- Case attribute `iteration_coordinate` is renamed `name`.

- Solver option `err_on_maxiter` is renamed `err_on_non_converge`.

- Solver attribute `preconditioner` is renamed `precon`.

- Nonlinear solver option `reraise_child_analysiserror` now defaults to False.

- BroydenSolver and NewtonSolver linesearch now defaults to BoundsEnforceLS.

- OptionsDictionary option argument `_type` is renamed `types`.

- Component attribute `distributed` has been changed to an option.

- The attribute `root` of Problem is renamed `model`.

- Group attribute `nl_solver` is renamed `nonlinear_solver`.

- Group attribute `ln_solver` is renamed `linear_solver`.

- System attribute `metadata` is renamed `options`.

- `units = 'unitless'` is removed.  Use `units = None` instead.

- NewtonSolver attribute `line_search` is now `linesearch`.

- Multi-variable specification via list or tuple to IndepVarComp is now invalid. Use add_output for each variable instead.

- Driver method `set_simul_deriv_color` is removed. Use `use_fixed_coloring` instead.

- Problem setup method argument `vector_class` removed. Use `distributed_vector_class` instead.

- pyOptSparseDriver method `dynamic_simul_derivs` removed. Use `declare_coloring` instead.

## Backwards Incompatible NON-API Changes:

Note: These changes are not technically API related, but
still may cause your results to differ when upgrading.

- <POEM 012> The old implementation of KrigingSurrogate was hard coded to the
  `gesdd` method for inverses. The method is now an option, but we've changed
  the default to `gesvd` because its more numerically stable.
  This might introduce slight numerical changes to the Kriging fits.

## New Features:

- None


## Bug Fixes:
- None

# Release Notes for OpenMDAO 2.10.0

February 27, 2020

Note: This is the last release of OpenMDAO 2.X. Updating to this release will be a 
critical step in preparing for the OpenMDAO 3.X releases


## Backwards Incompatible API Changes: 

- <POEM 004> AkimaSplineComp and BsplineComp have been deprecated, replaced with SplineComp

- <POEM 008>
  - The user is now required to set a value for the solver option `solve_subsystems` 
    on Newton and Broyden solvers. Previously the default was `False`, but you will now get 
    a deprecation warning if this value is not explicitly set.

- Improvement to the bidirectional Jacobian coloring so it will fall back to 
  pure forward or reverse if thats faster

- Users can now set the shape for outputs of `BalanceComp` and `EqConstraintsComp`

- Improvements to `debug_print` for driver related to reporting which derivatives 
  are being computed when coloring is active

# Release Notes for OpenMDAO 2.9.1

October 8, 2019

2.9.1 is a quick patch release to correct a couple of issues:

## Bug Fixes:
- The previous release inadvertantly changed the default "bounds_enforce" option on the BoundsEnforce
  line search to "vector".  This release restores the default to the originally intended "scalar".
- The entry point for the `web_view` utility function was fixed. (Thank you Nicholas Bollweg)
- Fixed a bug that prevented model reconfigurability in certain situations.
- Fixed a missing `sqrt` in the documentation for the Hohmann example.
- Fixed a bug that prevented proper fallback from bidirectional coloring to unidirectional coloring
  in certain cases where the bidirectional coloring was worse than the unidirectional coloring.

## New Features:
- Small improvements were made to the MetaModel viewer, along with some additional testing.


***********************************
# Release Notes for OpenMDAO 2.9.0

October 1, 2019

## New Features:

- better detection of when you're running under MPI, and new environment variable to forcibly disable MPI
- users can now issue connections from within the `configure` method on group 
  (this is useful if you wanted to be able to interrogate your children before issuing connections)
- significant overhead reduction due to switching from 'np.add.at' to 'np.bincount' for some matrix-vector
  products and data transfers.

- `openmdao` command line tool: 
    - new `openmdao scaffold` command line tool to quickly bootstrap component and group files
    - `openmdao summary` command gives more data including number of constraints
    - `openmdao tree` command now uses different colors for implicit and explicit components and 
      includes sizes of inputs and outputs
    - the `openmdao --help` tool gives better formatted help now

- CaseRecording: 
    - Case objects now have a `name` attribute to make identifying them simpler
    - Case objects now support __getitem__ (i.e. <case>[<some_var>]) and the
      get_val/set_val methods to directly mimic the problem interface
    - list_inputs and list_outputs methods on Case objects now support optional includes and excludes patterns     

- Documentation:    
    - added documentation for the list_inputs and list_outputs method on the Case object
    - added example use of implicit component for add_discrete_input docs
    - some minor cleanup to the cantilever beam optimization example to remove some unused code

- Derivatives: 
    - slightly different method of computing the total derivative sparsity pattern has been implemented
      that should be a bit more robust (but YMMV)
    - the partials object passed into `linearize` and `compute_partials` methods on implicit
      and explicit component respectively can now be iterated on like a true dictionary

- Solvers: 
    - a true Goldstein condition was added to the ArmijoGoldstein line search 
      (you can now choose if you want Armijo or Goldstein) *** Peter Onodi ***
    - DirectSolver now works under MPI 
      (but be warned that it might be very slow to use it this way, because it does a lot of MPI communication!!!)
    - BroydenSolver now works in parallel
    - improved error message when you have a nonconverged solver 
    - improved error message when solver failure is due to Nan or Inf

- Components: 
    - list_inputs and list_outputs methods on System objects now support optional includes and excludes patterns
    - variables can now have tags added as additional meta-data when they are declared,
      which can then be used to filter the output from list_inputs and list_ouputs 
    - significant speed improvements and increased surrogate options for StructuredMetaModel
    - improved error message when required options are not provided to a component during instantiation
    - user gets a clear error msg if they try to use `np.` or `numpy.` namespaces inside ExecComp strings
    - in the declare_coloring method, a threshold can now be set such that the generated coloring must improve
      things at least as much as the given percentage or the coloring will not be used. This can happen in cases
      where multiple instances of the same component class appear in a given model and each instance can potentially
      generate a different sparsity which results in a different coloring.

- Problem
    - user can set specific slices of variables using the set_val method on problem
    - added problem.compute_jacvec_prod function for matrix-free total derivative products. 
      Useful for wrapping for loops around an OpenMDAO problem and propagating derivatives through it.

- Visualization
    - minor reformatting of the N2 menu to make better use of vertical screen space
    - new visualziation tool for examining the surrogates in StructuredMetaModelComp and UnstructuredMetaModelComp
    - improved `openmdao view_connections` functionality for better filtering and toggling between 
      promoted and absolute names
    - component names can now optionally be shown on the diagonal for XDSM diagrams *** Peter Onodi ***

## Backwards Incompatible API Changes:

May 28, 2019

## New Features:

- You can now define guess_nonlinear method at the group level
- New documentation added about the N2 diagram usage
- Significant improvement to documentation search functionality
  (by default, only searches the feature docs and user guide now)

- Derivatives: 
    - Improved support for full-model complex-step when models have guess_nonlinear methods defined
    - **Experimental** FD and CS based coloring methods for partial derivative approximation 
      Valuable for efficiently using FD/CS on vectorized (or very sparse) components

- Solvers: 
    - `Solver failed to converge` message now includes solver path name to make it more clear what failed
    - Improved pathname information in the singular matrix error from DirectSolver
    - Directsolver has an improved error message when it detects identical rows or columns in Jacobian
    - NonlinearGaussSeidel solver now accounts for residual scaling in its convergence criterion
    - New naming scheme for solver debug print files (the old scheme was making names so long it caused OSErrors)

- Components: 
    - ExecComp now allows unit=<something> and shape=<something> arguments that apply to all variables in the expression
    - New AkimaSpline component with derivatives with respect to training data inputs

- Visualization
    - Several improvements for the N2 diagram for large models

    - `openmdao view_model` command line utility now supports case record database files

- (Experimental) Automatic XDSM generator (using either Latex with pyXDSM or html with XDSMjs)
  *** contributed by Peter Onodi ***
  *** uses XDSMjs v0.6.0 by Rémi Lafage (https://github.com/OneraHub/XDSMjs) ***

## Backwards Incompatible API Changes: 
- New APIs for total derivative coloring that are more consistent with partial derivative coloring
  (previous APIs are deprecated and coloring files generated with the previous API will not work)
- The API for providing a guess function to the BalanceComp has changed. 
  guess_function is now passed into BalanceComp as an init argument
- Changed the N2 diagram json data formatting to make the file size smaller 
  You can't use older case record databases to generate an N2 diagram with latest version
- All component methods related to execution now include `discrete_inputs` and `discrete_outputs` arguments 
  when a component is defined with discrete i/o. (if no discrete i/o is defined, the API remains unchanged)
  (includes `solve_nonlinear`, `apply_nonlinear`, `linearize`, `apply_linear`, `compute`, `compute_jac_vec_product`, `guess_nonlinear`) 
- The internal Driver API has changed, a driver should execute the model with `run_solve_nonlinear` to ensure that proper scaling operations occur 

## Bug Fixes:
- CaseRecorder was reporting incorrect values of scaled variables (analysis was correct, only case record output was wrong)
- the problem level `record_iteration` method was not properly respecting the `includes` specification
- ExecComp problem when vectorize=True, but only shape was defined. 
- Incorrect memory allocation in parallel components when local size of output went to 0
- Multidimensional `src_indices` were not working correctly with assembled Jacobians
- Fixed problem with genetic algorithm not working with vector design variables *** contributed by jennirinker ***
- Fixed incompatibility with mpich mpi library causing "PMPI_Allgather(945).: Buffers must not be aliased" error *** fzhale and nbons ***

# Release Notes for OpenMDAO 2.6.0

February 22, 2018

## New Features:
- MetaModelStructured will detect NaN in requested sample and print a readable message.
- ScipyOptimizeDriver now supports Hessian calculation option for optimizers that use it.
- User can specify src_indices that have duplicates or have two inputs on a single component connected to the same output, and still have CSC Jacobian work.
- User can get/set problem values in a straightforward manner: prob['var'] = 2., etc. even when running in parallel.
    - Problem 'get' access to distributed variables will raise an exception since it isn't clear what behavior is expected,
      i.e. should prob['comp.x'] return the full distributed variable or just the local part.
- Directsolver has an improved error message when it detects identical rows or columns in Jacobian.
- The NonlinearBlockGS solver has been updated with a less expensive implementation that does not call the compute method of Explicit components as many times.
- User can request a directional-derivative check (similar to SNOPTs built-in level 0 check) for check_partials.
- check_partials with compact_print will now always show all check pairs.
- The N^2 diagram (from `openmdao view_model`) now shows the solver hierarchy.
- KSComp has an improved, vectorized implementation.
- list_inputs now includes a 'shape' argument.
- User can generate an XDSM from a model (`openmdao xdsm`).
- User can set `units=<something>` for an execcomp, when all variables have the same units.

## Backwards Incompatible API Changes:
- The default bounds enforcement for BoundsEnforceLS is now 'scalar' (was 'vector')
- Direct solver will now use 'assemble_jac=True' by default
- Recording options 'includes' and 'excludes' now use promoted names for outputs (absolute path names are still used for inputs)
- FloatKrigingSurrogate has been deprecated since it does not provide any unique functionality.
- FloatMultifiKrigingSurrogate has been deleted because it was never used, was incorrectly implemented, and provides no new functionality.

##  Bug Fixes:
- Complex-step around Newton+DirectSolver now works with assembled Jacobians.
- Armijolinesearch implementation was incorrect when used with solve_subsystems. The implementation is now correct.

***********************************
# Release Notes for OpenMDAO 2.5.0

October 31, 2018

## New Features:
- list_outputs() method now includes a `prom_name` argument to include the promoted name in the printed output (Thanks John Jasa!).
- N2 viewer now includes tool tip (hover over) showing the promoted name of any variable.
- Improved error msg when building sparse partials with duplicate col/row entries.
- You can now build the docs without MPI/PETSc installed (you will get warnings, but no longer errors).
- Major internal refactor to reduce overhead on compute_totals calls (very noticeable on large design spaces but still cheap problems).
- Components now have a `under_complex_step` attribute you can check to see if complex-step is currently active.
- Components `distributed` attribute has been moved to an option (old attribute has been deprecated).
- MetaModelUnstructured will now use FD for partial derivatives of surrogates that don't provide analytic derivatives (user can override the default settings if they wish to use CS or different FD config).
- Improvements to SimpleGA to make it more stable, and added support constraints via penalty functions (Thanks madsmpedersen and onodip).
- Parallel FD and CS at the component and group level is now supported.
- Can turn off the analytic derivative sub-system if it is not needed via an argument to setup().
- Derivative coloring now works for problems that run under MPI.

- New Components in the standard library:
    - Mux and Demux components.

- New CaseRecording/CaseReading Features:
    - DesVar AND output variable bounds are both reordered now.
    - Improved error msg if you try to load a non-existent file with CaseReader.

- **Experimental Feature**: Discrete data passing is now supported as an experimental feature... we're still testing it, and may change the API!

## Backwards Incompatible API Changes:
-- `get_objectives` method on CaseReader now returns a dict-like object.
- Output vector is now locked (read-only) when inside the `apply_nonlinear` method (you shouldn't have been changing it then anyway!).
- default step size for complex-step has been changed to 1e-40.
- Moderate refactor of the CaseReader API. It is now self-consistent.

***********************************
# Release Notes for OpenMDAO 2.4.0

August 1, 2018

## New Features:
- Better error message when upper and lower have the wrong shape for add_design_var and add_constraint methods.
- pyOptSparseDriver now runs the initial condition for ALPSO and NSGA-II optimizers.

    - <Problem>.load_case() method lets you pull values from a case back into the problem.
    - Updated the Case recording format for better performance.
    - User can call <Problem>.record_iteration() to save specific cases.
      Recording options for this method are separate from driver/solver options.
      This is so you can record one (or more) cases manually with *ALL* the variables in it if you want to.

## Backwards Incompatible API Changes:
- The input and output vectors are now put into read-only modes within certain component methods.
  NOTE: This REALLY REALLY should not break anyone's models, but it is technically a backwards-incompatible change...
        If you were changing values in these arrays when you shouldn't have been, you're going to get an error now.
        Fix it... the new error is enforcing correct behavior.
        If it was working before, you got lucky.

## Bug Fixes:
- Various small bug fixes to check_partials and check_totals.
- ArmijoGoldstein linesearch iteration counter works correctly now.
- the record_derivatives recorder_option now actually does something!

# Release Notes for OpenMDAO 2.3.1

June 20, 2018

- OpenMDAO command line utility now works under MPI.
- ExternalCodeComp has new option, `allowed_return_codes` to specify valid return codes.

- New Analytic Derivatives Features
    - Major re-write of the Feature documentation on the Core Feature, "Working with Analytic Derivatives."
    - User can now set AssembledJacobians for linear solvers. (Big speedup for a lot of lower-order or serial problems).

    - Automatic simultaneous coloring algorithm for separable problems to speed up derivatives calculations.
    - Option for caching of linear solution vectors to speed up linear solves when using iterative solvers.
    - check_partials now allows you to use `includes` and `excludes` to limit which components get checked.

- New Components in the standard library:
    - CrossProductComp
    - DotProductComp
    - MatrixVectorProductComp
    - ExternalCodeImplicitComp
    - EQConstraintComp

    - ExternalCode -> ExternalCodeComp

- Driver metadata/options can now be set via init args (can still be set as options as well).
- User no longer needs to specify PETSCvector for parallel cases (the framework figures it out now).

- check_totals and check_partials no longer support the `supress_output` argument. Use `out_stream=None` instead.


## Backwards-Incompatible API Changes:
- `comps` argument in check_partials was replaced with `includes` and `excludes` arguments.
- Re-design of the CaseReader API. Unification of all cases, and simpler iteration over case hierarchies.
- `partial_type` argument for LinearSystemComponent has been removed

April 2, 2018

## New Features:
- check_partials() improvements to formatting and clarity. Report of potentially-bad derivatives summarized at bottom of output.

- Added generic KS component.
- Added generic Bspline component.
- Improved error msg when class is passed into add_subsystem.
- Automated Jacobian coloring algorithm now works across all variables (previously, it was just local within a variable).

## Backwards-Compatible API Changes:
N/A

## Backwards-Incompatible API changes:
N/A

## Bug Fixes:
