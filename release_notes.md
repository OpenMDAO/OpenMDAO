# Release Notes for OpenMDAO 3.32.0

May 03, 2024

OpenMDAO 3.32.0 is a regular update with a few new features and several bug fixes. We're continuing to refine our submodel implementation, and now we give the user explicit access to the subproblem so that they can interact with it
using the `Problem` API.

POEM 093 is implemented, which allows caching of the linear solution which can improve performance in some situations.

The `assert_near_equal` utility for testing can now be set to only enforce absolute error, in cases where the nominal value is small and relative error isn't meaningful.

We now support scipy's differential evolution optimizer's ability to enforce constraints.

From a Python development perspective we've upgraded from using `setup.py` to using `pyproject.toml`, which should hep users who want to manage OpenMDAO installation with non-pip tools, like `poetry`.

The `openmdao graph` command has been added as a quick way to visualize the call graph in OpenMDAO. This is mostly for debugging purposes as it can get very complex with any sizable model.

# Release Notes for OpenMDAO 3.31.1

March 15, 2024

OpenMDAO 3.31.1 is a patch release to fix a bug in the newly deprecated `list_problem_vars` function, which was no longer returning the expected data.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed bug in deprecated list_problem_vars() function. [#3149](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/3149)

# Release Notes for OpenMDAO 3.31.0

March 15, 2024

This release includes a significant refactor that affects the calculation of relevance.
Derivatives are no longer inherently coupled to drivers.  This makes it possible to compute derivatives of a system
without having to add a "dummy" driver with the appropriate constraints and design variables. The SubmodelComp has been
refactored to reflect these changes. Relevance and 'pre/opt/post' driver logic has also been refactored for more uniformity.

Previously, the stalling of nonlinear solvers was detected using relative tolerance. If any subsolves had already been converged, solvers can see little-to-no improvement in the relative error, despite the absolute tolerance being fine. OpenMDAO now allows `stall_tol_type` to be `'abs'` or `'rel'` so that the user
has more control over the detection of stalling solvers.

Attempting to a assign a linesearch to a solver that doesn't support it will now result in an error.

We no longer test against Python 3.7, as the python foundation no longer supports that version and some of our dependencies no longer work with it.

Previously, there was no way of changing the top-level reports directory in the public API, and setting the corresponding environment variable had
no effect after OpenMDAO was imported. The `set_reports_dir` has now been added to `openmdao.api`.

Given some of the significant internal changes in this release, we tested it as thoroughly as we could. If you find
any changes that break your models, please submit an issue so we can resolve them quickly.

## New Deprecations

- Renamed `list_problem_vars` to `list_driver_vars` [#3132](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/3132)

## Backwards Incompatible API Changes

The jacobian as returned by compute_totals is now keyed with the 'user facing' names given to the design variables and responses, rather than the absolute names that were used previously. OpenMDAO's general rule of thumb is that users see "promoted names" or aliases for variables. [#3113](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/3113)

The automatic determination of derivative 'mode' is now done separately for the driver vs. a direct call to `compute_totals` or `check_totals` with a set of 'of' and 'wrt' variables that may differ from the driver responses and design variables. This can modify the keys in the dictionary return value of `check_totals`, where for example the dict used to contain a 'J_fwd' key because it ran in fwd mode, it might now contain a 'J_rev' key instead because the best derivative mode was determined to be 'rev' based on the relative sizes of the 'of' and 'wrt' variables passed to `check_totals`. [#3142](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/3142)

## Backwards Incompatible Non-API Changes

- Changed `find_plugins` to `find_repos` and changed it to use tabulator.js [#3144](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/3144)

## New Features

- Added option `stall_tol_type` to Nonlinear solvers. [#3112](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/3112)
- Refactored relevance and removed driver dependency for coloring. [#3113](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/3113)
- Updated ScipyKrylov for SciPy 1.12.0, updated 'latest' workflow. [#3114](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/3114)
- Moved two functions from the n2 code to the utils part of the code. (`convert_ndarray_to_support_nans_in_json` and `convert_nans_in_nested_list`) so other libraries can use them. [#3116](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/3116)
- Assigning a `linesearch` to a solver that does not support one will result in an error. [#3131](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/3131)
- Added `set_reports_dir` to `openmdao.api`. [#3137](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/3137)
- Moved pre/opt/post logic into the Relevance class. [#3142](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/3142)

## Bug Fixes

- In the Custom report example, made sure the entry point doesn't collide with our default names. [#3092](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/3092)
- Fixed an error in the coefficient calculation for 2D slinear interp. [#3094](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/3094)

- ScipyKrylov will no longer return an invalid solution if the solver did not converge. [#3107](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/3107)
- Skip any relevance/singular_jac checks when `approx_totals` is used. [#3117](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/3117)
- Fixed a bug in the hook system. [#3125](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/3125)
- Updated `check_partials` to account for scaling when using the matrix-free API. [#3126](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/3126)

# Release Notes for OpenMDAO 3.30.0

December 07, 2023

This release continues some improvements for MPI and various bug fixes.

Reverse mode transfers were refactored to address some bugs that manifested in certain situations under MPI.
In an effort to put all output files in a single location by default, output files generated by optimizers will now be sent to the reports directory.

Since users interact with promoted variable names rather than absolute, pyOptSparseDriver and Coloring now use promoted names on outputs.

The optional dependency pyDOE2 is seemingly unsupported.
New changes in its dependencies required updates which are now being maintained at https://github.com/relf/pyDOE3

As usual, the full list of pull requests follows:

## New Deprecations

# Release Notes for OpenMDAO 3.29.0

October 20, 2023

Key improvements in this release include the implementation of POEM 092, which allows users to define
a pre-processor function for options. This can be used to facilitate processing of options, such as
handling unit conversions.

POEM 091 forces a component to use _either_ jacobian-based partials or the matrix-free API. Using both
is no longer allowed.

Finally, POEM 038 is implemented which currently raises a deprecation error if a user
declares a partial whose value is exactly zero. In the future this will be an error,
since the "correct" behavior is to not declare such partials at all.

The coloring report has been reimplemented in bokeh and is more interactive. Users with problems
whose systems exhibit significant sparsity may find this useful.

Key bug fixes include a fix for a problem where Submodel components weren't working properly in complex-step mode.
Also, the relatively new `add_residual` feature wasn't able to be called during configure. This has been fixed.

## New Deprecations

- Declaring partials with values equal to exactly zero will now result in a deprecation warning, and in the future will result in an error. [#3050](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/3050)

## Backwards Incompatible API Changes

- None

# Release Notes for OpenMDAO 3.27.0

June 26, 2023

The release of OpenMDAO 3.27.0 implements several new features implemented based on proposals
submitted as [POEMS](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/POEMs).
Highlights of newly implemented features are:

### POEM_077: Derivative checks with multiple step sizes.

The user may now specify the step as a sequence of step sizes to test the impact of step size on finite difference accuracy.

### POEM_081: Submodel component.

SubmodelComp provides a way to evaluate an OpenMDAO Problem within a Component. When using a SubmodelComp, the subproblem
exposes only a limited number of inputs and outputs of the underlying model to the parent system. This may be beneficial
from a performance standpoint when there are many inputs and outputs of the internal model that aren’t needed in the top-level model.

### POEM_084: OpenMDAO jax subpackage.

In an effort to remove the need for users to find analytic derivatives for their components, we initially
started down the path of providing common mathematical operations and their derivatives. It soon
became apparent that leveraging automatic differentiation was the way to go. We've added the
OpenMDAO jax subpackage which adds a few functions built on top of jax's already extensive `jax.numpy`
subpackage and added examples of how to use jax for automatic differentiation of partials. This will
allow users to compose more complex component compute methods without breaking them up for the sake
of easier differentiation. Going forward, we're going to advocate jax more and more as a way
to reduce the time required to develop working models.

### POEM_085: View connections can now save to CSV format.

Users found applying a diff to CSV representations of connections to be a useful way of determining differences between two models.
This POEM allows view_connections to output a CSV file instead of HTML.

### POEM_086: Model options

Users have requested an easier way to set options recursively on deep models, and model options are designed to satisfy this need.
`Problem.model_options` is now a dictionary keyed by a string. If the path of a given system in the model is a glob-match of the key, then it looks at the
corresponding option/value pairs in the model_options dictionary and attempts to set the value of any options that exist for that System.
This is a generic implementation and by using a standard dictionary, users may specify this common options in their run script or use various serialization formats as configuration files for their particular model.

### POEM_089: The automatic grouping of systems into "pre", "opt", and "post" sets.

When the user sets the Problem option `'group_by_pre_opt_post'`, OpenMDAO will attempt to determine how components
impact outputs needed for optimization.
If components are not dependent upon the design variables they will be grouped into the "pre" set which is evaluated once prior to the optimization iteration.
If components are functions of the design variables of the optimization, they are grouped into the "opt" set which is evaluated during each iteration of the driver.
Components that are identified as "post-processing" components that only need to be run after the optimization is complete are grouped into the "post" set.

This grouping can significantly speed up optimization in some cases by eliminated unnecessary computation.
It is currently turned off by default. Users will need to set the Problem option `'group_by_pre_opt_post'` to test this behavior.
If a user desires to have a Component's compute always run during optimziation iterations, they can set the new component option `'always_opt'` to force it to be a member of the "opt" set.
Note that using this may add other components to the opt set depending on the flow of data in the model.

# Release Notes for OpenMDAO 3.26.0

April 14, 2023

The release of OpenMDAO 3.26.0 primarily removes a lengthy list of long-standing deprecations that we will no longer
be carrying forward. There's a reasonable chance that this release will break existing models, so find any deprecation
warnings that may exist in your current case and address them. Highlights among these are
- The ability to use a component as a problem's model is removed (OpenMDAO expects a Group so that an AutoIVC component can be added)
- `assert_rel_error` removed in favor of `assert_near_equal`
- OpenMDAO now expects the keyword `val` rather than `value` in many functions and methods.
- Deprecated names for some interpolants (Akima1D and trilinear) are no longer supported.
- src_indices may no longer be used as an argument to add_input (use it during connect or promotes instead).

A few POEM's have been implemented. POEM 078 changes system methods `list_inputs` and `list_outputs` to now support
keyword arguments `is_indep_var` and `is_design_var` to help users filter inputs.
POEM 082 adds a similar method, `Problem.get_indep_vars` which will allow the user to find all variables in the problem
that are provided by IndepVarComps (or systems that mimic them).

OptionsDictionary now supports a `set` method to allow users to set multiple options in a single line.

# Release Notes for OpenMDAO 3.25.0

January 27, 2023

OpenMDAO 3.25.0 includes only one change, which is the convention OpenMDAO uses when transferring data between distributed and non-distributed variables. The underlying principle is that serial variables and their derivatives must have consistent values across all ranks where those variables exist.

This is a backwards incompatible change that could break some matrix-free components with a mix of distributed and non-distributed variables.  Users developing components involving distributed inputs should consult [POEM 075](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/POEMs/blob/master/POEM_075.md).

## New Deprecations

- None

## Backwards Incompatible API Changes

- **POEM 75** implementation: changes the convention OpenMDAO uses when transferring data between distributed and non-distributed variables. [#2751](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/2751)

***********************************
# Release Notes for OpenMDAO 3.24.0

January 25, 2023

OpenMDAO 3.24.0 serves as a transitional release that marks a change in the way distributed I/O is handled.
Moving forward from 3.25.0 onward, users developing components involving distributed inputs should consult
[POEM 075](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/POEMs/blob/master/POEM_075.md), as OpenMDAO is changing this convention
and the switch will not be backwards compatible.

For the N2 diagram, we've added information about connections between systems when a connection node is highlighted in
NodeInfo mode.

## New Deprecations

- **POEM 75** implementation: Problems involving systems with distributed inputs will raise a deprecation regarding upcoming changes to their behavior. [#2784](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/2784)

## Backwards Incompatible API Changes

- None

## Backwards Incompatible Non-API Changes

- None

## New Features

- N2: Connections displayed during mouseover of a connection node when in NodeInfo mode [#2778](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/2778)
- Added set_val as a method of System. [#2785](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/2785)

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug in the handling of design variable bounds conditions when using COBYLA. [#2770](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/2770)
- Fixed a bug in System.get_io_metadata() that caused the `discrete` property to always be shown as `True`. [#2771](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/2771)
- Fixed a bug that prevented `Problem.set_solver_print` from impacting output in multi-run scenarios [#2773](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/2773)
- Fixed a bug in `set_output_solver_options`, `set_design_var_options`, and `set_constraint_options` that prevented them from working when given vector values. [#2782](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/2782)

# Release Notes for OpenMDAO 3.23.0

January 10, 2023

OpenMDAO 3.23.0 fixes a few bugs and and provides functionality with numpy 1.24, which removed several previously deprecated features.

POEM 79 is implemented. This will cause a warning to be issued if the initial value of a design variable is outside of the bounds it was given.
Previously, this behavior was handled differently by different optimizers, with `IPOPT` clipping the values to lay within the bounds, while other optimizers just silently proceeded starting from an invalid design point.
More often than not, setting design variables to invalid values is an oversight by the user and so they will receive a warning in the current release if such a condition is found.
This warning will be changed to an exception in OpenMDAO 3.25, but the user will continue to have the ability to choose whether OpenMDAO warns, raises, or ignores the condition.

We've also addressed several bugs that were found by users, so please continue to submit those issues.

## New Deprecations

- **POEM 79** implementation: Warning issued for design variables whose initial value exceeds their bounds. This will become an exception in OpenMDAO 3.25. [#2747](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/2747)

## Backwards Incompatible API Changes

- None

## Backwards Incompatible Non-API Changes

- Updates for numpy 1.24 removed features. [#2738](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/2738)

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug with units check when design variable is specified in a Component. [#2742](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/2742)
- Fixed a bug regarding size 0 arrays in inputs report. [#2743](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/2743)
- Fixed an errant warning when regarding non-existent report hooks. [#2744](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/2744)
- The optimization report should now correctly compute the min/max value for discrete desvars. [#2746](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/2746)

## Miscellaneous

- Added skipUnless to a couple distributed recording tests that need pyDOE2 [#2733](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/2733)
- Temporarily ignored GitPython vulnerability in audit [#2734](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/2734)

# Release Notes for OpenMDAO 3.22.0

December 14, 2022

OpenMDAO 3.22.0 contains a variety of new user-facing capabilities and bug fixes.
Here are some of the highlights:

We've removed our dependency on the tabulate package.
The dependencies on pyDOE2 and pyparsing are no longer required unless the user
attempts to use an OpenMDAO feature that requires them. In this case, that means
the DOEDriver or the external code file-wrapping capabilities, respectively.

OpenMDAO will now raise an exception if a single solver instance is attached to multiple systems.

We've implemented several [POEMs](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/POEMs) in this release.
POEM 74 is implemented, and OpenMDAO will suggest closely-matching connection targets if you happen to misspell it during the `connect` call.
POEM 70 adds a new _inputs report_ (`inputs.html`) that allows the user to quickly view the available inputs in a model, see which are ultimately connected to IndepVarComps, and to see which are design variables controlled by the Driver.
POEM 69 allows users to provide more clear names for the residuals associated with implicit outputs, rather than assigning them the same name.
Users were sometimes confused that the existing implementation seemed to associate some residuals specifically with some outputs, when in reality it often just matters that a solver be given `N` implicit outputs and `N` corresponding residuals.

## New Deprecations

- Setting `prob.model` to a component is now deprecated, as the technical burden of supporting this corner case has outweighed its usefulness. The `model` assigned to a Problem should now always be a Group.

## Backwards Incompatible API Changes

- None

## Backwards Incompatible Non-API Changes

- None

## New Features

- **POEM 70** implementation: Added the inputs report, and a generate_table function to eliminate dependency on the tabulate package. [#2655](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/2655)
- Added a command line test for the scaling report. [#2657](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/2657)
- Changed ImplicitComponent.apply_nonlinear() to raise NotImplementedError [#2664](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/2664)
- Changed check_partials to skip components with no outputs or no inputs [#2667](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/2667)
- OpenMDAO will now consider relevance information when running _linearize. As a result of this change, a component with finite differenced or complex stepped partials will not compute them for inputs that do not contribute to the model relevancy (as measured from the model's objectives and constraints to the design variables.) [#2675](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/2675)
- **POEM 74** implementation: Suggest variables for failed connection [#2681](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/2681)

- Changed default for Driver supports['optimization'] to False [#2715](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/2715)
- Deprecated Component as a model, handle gracefully. [#2716](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/2716)
- Added pyoptsparse to windows build on GitHub Actions. [#2718](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/2718)
- Removed pyparsing as an explicit OpenMDAO dependency. [#2723](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/2723)
- OpenMDAO will now raise an exception if a solver is assigned to more than one System [#2724](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/2724)
- Cached setup errors so they can be raised at one time. [#2726](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/2726)

## Bug Fixes

# Release Notes for OpenMDAO 3.21.0

September 28, 2022

OpenMDAO 3.21.0 implements several bug fixes and a few new capabilities. DOEDriver can now compute and record
derivatives, which can be useful for testing. AnalysisError will now correctly feed back to IPOPT when using
pyoptsparse. This feature previously worked only with SNOPT. The behavior with other optimizers varies as not all
are capable of dealing with failed analyses. Finally, `assert_no_approx_partials`, from `openmdao.utils.assert_utils`,
can now be used to separately test models and their children for the presence of partials approximated with
complex-step, finite-difference, or both.

# Release Notes for OpenMDAO 3.18.0

May 05, 2022

OpenMDAO 3.18.0 adds some enhanced MPI capability to OpenMDAO, and includes several bug fixes and internal cleanup.

The implementation of [POEM 065](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/POEMs/blob/master/POEM_065.md) allows users to specify
`proc_group` for subsystems in ParallelGroups. This enables the grouping of less computationally expensive subsystems onto
fewer processors to achieve better balancing.

We also recently discovered that `math.prod` in the standard Python library as of 3.8 is over an order of magnitude
faster than `numpy.prod` for reasonably small arrays. Since this function is frequently used to determine sizes given
the shape of a variable in OpenMDAO-related tools, we've updated the `shape_to_len` function to take advantage of it
and encourage users to use this implementation over `numpy.prod`.

The generalization of the N2 diagram also continues in this release, with a goal of allowing its use in other contexts.

## New Deprecations

- None

## Backwards Incompatible API Changes

- None

## Backwards Incompatible Non-API Changes

- None

## New Features

- Implemented [POEM 065](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/POEMs/blob/master/POEM_065.md), allowing user to specify `proc_group` and `proc_weight` for subsystems. [#2487](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/2487)
- Allow pyoptsparse `opt_prob` to be printed before optimization with `print_opt_prob` option. [#2492](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/2492)
- Updated `shape_to_len` and made it call `math.prod` if Python >= 3.8. [#2512](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/2512)

# Release Notes for OpenMDAO 3.17.0

March 21, 2022

OpenMDAO 3.17.0 adds a few significant capabilities, as well as several bugfixes and performance improvements.

The first major capability is the addition of a reports system.  OpenMDAO has provided various feedback through
standard output, either automatically or at the users request.  The new report capability will allow OpenMDAO to provide
richer feedback via html and other outputs.  In addition, reports that are useful and cheap to generate, such as the N2
diagram and the scaling report, will be generated automatically and placed in a reports directory.  The location of
this reports directory is user-configurable, and options exists for disabling reports when they are unwanted.  Finally,
the reports system is intended to be extensible, so developers of tools which use OpenMDAO will be able to generate
their own reports.

OpenMDAO will now also allow aliases for constraints.  This feature will enable users to apply multiple constraints
to the same variable - such as imposing a equality constraint on one array element and lower/upper bounds on other
elements.  In the past, users would typically create new "pass-thru" components that would accept different portions
of these array outputs.  Using the OpenMDAO model hierarchy to "namespace" constraints is also no longer necessary,
since aliases can be used to give a more human-readable description of the constraint.

We're continuing to add visualization tools. This release features OptionsWidget and CaseViewer.  OptionsWidget provides
a simple GUI to change options of a model in a Jupyter notebook.  CaseViewer provides a GUI for rapidly plotting
variables across case iterations from a case record file.  CaseViewer currently only works in a Jupyter notebook,
but we plan on allowing it to be used as a standalone tool in the future.

## New Deprecations

- Added deprecation if options names are not valid python names. [#2378](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/2378)

## Backwards Incompatible API Changes

# Release Notes for OpenMDAO 3.16.0

January 06, 2022

OpenMDAO 3.16.0 fixes the definition of the "Kelvin as energy" unit, improves documentation and exception handling, adds verification that options names are valid python names, and adds improvements to the N2 visualization.

We've also adjusted our nomenclature with respect to parallel processing.
Instead of inputs and outputs either being "distributed" or "serial", we now refer to them as "distributed" or "non-distributed."

Finally, the minimum supported version of Python is now 3.7, since 3.6 has reached the end of its life.  While OpenMDAO may still work with prior versions of Python, we recommend users upgrade to supported versions.

# Release Notes for OpenMDAO 3.15.0

November 24, 2021

OpenMDAO 3.15.0 is released to address a derivative bug in the new 1D-akima interpolant.

Calling `set_val` on a variable that is ultimately sourced from 'AutoIVC' was causing a poorly worded error when the given value was not compatible.
This has ben fixed.

It also adds a new explicitly `'unitless'` unit.
Currently the standard practice is to use `None` as the units for dimensionless quantities.
Variables with units `None` are allowed to be connected to variables of other units, and no conversion is performed.
Using `'unitless'` will all users more rigorous checking when connecting a dimensionless unit to another variable.

The new unit `'percent'`, is also added, which is defined as `unitless/100`.

## New Deprecations

- None

## Backwards Incompatible API Changes

- None

## Backwards Incompatible Non-API Changes

# Release Notes for OpenMDAO 3.13.0

October 06, 2021

OpenMDAO 3.13.0 implements a change in the way indices are handled.
See [POEM 053](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/POEMs/blob/master/POEM_053.md) and [POEM 054](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/POEMs/blob/master/POEM_054.md)
for more information.

We've also added some security to the OpenMDAO repository by requiring GPG-signed commits when accepting pull requests.
This is an extra layer of security that helps prevent nefarious pull-requests from being made to the code-base.
See the documentation [here](http://openmdao.org/twodocs/versions/latest/other_useful_docs/developer_docs/signing_commits.html) for more information.

## New Deprecations

- Behavior of `'rel'` step_calc for finite difference is changed and issues a deprecation warning if used, see [#2209](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/2209) for more information.

## Backwards Incompatible API Changes

- When indexing into multi-dimensional arrays while connecting or adding design variables, constraints, or objectives, the indices will now behave like numpy indices.  Flattened behavior can be achieved using `flat_src_indices` (in connections) or `flat_indices` (in other methods).

## Backwards Incompatible Non-API Changes

- None

## New Features

- Completed the transition to numpy style indexing described in POEM_054. [#2279](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/2279)
- Added information on min and max values of array variables in our list methods per [POEM 055](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/POEMs/blob/master/POEM_055.md).  Thank you @andrewellis55 for the contribution. [#2280](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/2280)
- Added an implementation of the function metadata API per [POEM 056](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/POEMs/blob/master/POEM_056.md) [#2281](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/2281)
- Improved performance of cubic metamodel interpolation, and added interpolants `akima1d` and `trilinear` that are limited to fixed dimensions and no derivatives wrt the training data, but are significantly faster. These interpolants are currently under development so some changes to the API may occur. [#2285](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/2285)

## Bug Fixes

- None

## Miscellaneous

- Added docs for signing/verifying commits [#2273](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/2273)
- remove unused travis CI files [#2274](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/2274)
- Fix test that was failing due to varying precision in warning message. [#2287](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/2287)

# Release Notes for OpenMDAO 3.12.0

September 15, 2021

OpenMDAO 3.12.0 provides a transitional release as we change the way the specification of indices are handled.

# Release Notes for OpenMDAO 3.9.0

April 28, 2021

OpenMDAO 3.9.0 features an API change to the serial/parallel implementation
in OpenMDAO, a significant performance increase in approximated partials,
and several other improvements.

Most OpenMDAO components allow inputs and outputs to be added after the
component is instantiated.  This now applies to ExecComp as well.  New
expressions can be added to ExecComp using the `add_expr` method.

OpenMDAO can sometimes produce numerous verbose warnings during setup.
We now implement our own Warning classes so that the verbosity of these
warnings can be changed through the use of Python's warning filtering
functionality.

See the following sections for a complete list of changes.

## New Deprecations

- Environment variable OPENMDAO_REQUIRE_MPI is now OPENMDAO_USE_MPI. [#1968](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/1968)

## Backwards Incompatible API Changes:

- dynamically shaped connection between distributed outputs and serial inputs are no longer allowed. [#2013](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/2013)
- dynamically shaped connections now by default assume local data transfer to distributed inputs, i.e., size/shape and src_indices in the input correspond to the local part of the output. [#2013](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/2013)
- old behavior of connecting distributed outputs to serial inputs was to have the serial input in each proc contain the full distributed size of the output. To achieve this same behavior, user must now specify src_indices for the input of om.slicer[:] (recommended) or an index array matching the full distrib size of the output. [#2013](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/2013)

## Backwards Incompatible NON-API Changes:

- None

## New Features:

- The unit 'as' for attoseconds now works. [#1963](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/1963)
- Warnings for MPI/PETSc failed import are now suppressed. [#1968](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/1968)
- Added OpenMDAO version to case recorder file [#1971](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/1971)
- Added `_setup_check()` hook that is called immediately after setup. [#1976](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/1976)
- User can now add expressions to ExecComp using "add_expr". [#1977](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/1977)
- Added argument to list_problem_vars to optionally return unscaled values. [#1980](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/1980)
- Added OpenMDAO-specific warnings. [#1982](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/1982)
- Added notebook utils for upcoming documentation built in Jupyter Book [#1984](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/1984)
- Reduced the size of the case database files by compressing JSON & BLOBs in case db, and create separate metadata db for parallel runs [#1989](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/1989)
- Decreased memory required for partial coloring by changing the way the sparsity matrix is computed. [#2000](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/2000)
- Added a change to get_val such that, when `from_src` is false, the data is obtained locally rather than from the source. [#2005](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/2005)
- Changed default behavior when computing src_indices between variables when one side is distributed. [#2013](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/2013)


## Bug Fixes:
- Fixed a bug where the global_size was incorrect for a design variable that is specified with indices on an IVC output declared as a distributed component. [#1986](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/1986)
- Generate more informative error message if a src_indices containing slicing operators was incorrectly set. [#1988](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/1988)
- Fix to allow showing N2 diagrams in Jupyter notebook when the file path is absolute. [#1998](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/1998)
- Disable USE_PROC_FILES when MPI is used in a notebook. [#2001](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/pull/2001)

# Release Notes for OpenMDAO 3.3.0

September 04, 2020

OpenMDAO 3.3.0 features some changes to the setup/configure stack that
are intended to make it easier to implement complex models in OpenMDAO.

The new group method `get_io_metadata` is available from the `configure`
method of Groups.  During setup, a Group's configure method is run
after the setup methods of all children have been run.
The `get_io_metadata` method allows one to inquire about the inputs and outputs
within the Group and its descendents.  For instance, it can be used to find the names,
units, and shapes of inputs and outputs in the descendent components of a Group.

A new Differential Evolution driver has been added.
This driver is for use on problems with continuous design variables,
and is roughly 3x faster than the existing Simple GA Driver.

## Backwards Incompatible API Changes:

- list_outputs will now return the system-relative promoted path of outputs
- list_inputs will now return the system-relative absolute path of inputs

## Backwards Incompatible NON-API Changes:

None

## New Features:

- Added more information to the node info window in the n2. #1610
- Removed warning when recording deprecated options in viewer data. #1613
- <POEM 029> Adds get_io_metadata method to retrieve metadata of underlying inputs and outputs. #1618
- Internal definition of undefined inputs is now managed with an _UNDEFINED constant in openmdao.core.constants. #1622
- N2 code getting tree dict updated to use _UNDEFINED constant. #1623
- When encountering an AnalysisError, drivers will now indicate which component raised the error. #1650
- Differential Evolution driver added. #1662
- <POEM 031> Added Aitken Relaxation to the Linear Block Gauss-Seidel solver. #1663
- Tagging capability added to AddSubtractComp #1664

# Release Notes for OpenMDAO 3.2.1

August 07, 2020

OpenMDAO 3.2.1 is a minor update intended to address issues introduced in 3.2.0.

On the user-facing side, there are continuing improvements to the N2 visualization tool.
Version 3.2.0 introduced the ability to use `om.slicer` to specify indices and src_indices via slices.  This update now allows the Ellipsis (`...`) in the specification of slices, which should make connecting subsets of multidimensional outputs much simpler.
Nonlinear solvers also now have the ability to detect stalls.

## Backwards Incompatible API Changes:

- Removed unused args from IndepVarComp.add_output #1576

## Backwards Incompatible NON-API Changes:


## New Features:

- Pinned N2 arrows are now transitioned between updates #1563
- Update vector API to eliminate the need to access internal vector data structures directly. This is a good idea in general but is mandatory for nocopy transfers, where the internal '_data' array in input vectors no longer contains storage for all of the variables. #1567
- Support for ellipsis objects in om.Slicer #1564
- Added Stall Detection to the nonlinear solvers. #1574

## Bug Fixes:

- Reworked error/warning behavior for set_input_defaults so that ambiguities resolved at a higher level trigger a warning instead of an error. #1568
- The N2 code and several areas of the docs still referenced param/unknown terms instead of input/output. These were updated, and a few other areas of N2 code were cleaned up as well. #1570
- An error message is now raised if set_val is called before setup. #1578
- Calls made to set_input_defaults inside of the configure method are no longer ignored. #1583
- When multiple inputs promoted to the same name were explicitly connected to an output, a units ambiguity error was generated even if all of the inputs had the same units. #1587
- Fixed bug in directional derivatives of implicit states when checking partials on a matrix-free component. #1589
- Allow BalanceComp I/O to be sized from rhs_val if val is unavailable #1591
- Fixed bug in group promotes with input src_indices being ignored. #1595

## Miscellaneous:

- Multiple versions of the TLDR Paraboloid example were consolidated #1555
- Fix for test failure on AppVeyor. Compare against Numpy integer datatype. #1586

**********************************
# Release Notes for OpenMDAO 3.2.0

July 21, 2020

OpenMDAO 3.2.0 introduces significant changes in the way OpenMDAO works.
The primary change is that the manual creation of IndepVarComp outputs is no longer required because OpenMDAO will create them for you in the background.
This was done in a backwards compatible way so that old models will still run and you can still use IndepVarComps if you want to.
However, in the vast majority of cases, you don't need to manually create either the IndepVarComp component or add outputs to it anymore.

This feature aids in creating modular systems. Previously, there was always debate as to whether a system should "own" its own IndepVarComp.
Doing so, however, meant that the outputs of that IVC couldn't be passed in externally without changing the system.
This is no longer the case.
Now any inputs that remain unconnected at the end of the problem setup sequence will be connected to special automatic IndepVarComp outputs that are addressable using the pathname of the inputs.
We have updated the docs to use the new style where IndepVarComps are not manually created. We now consider it best practice not to manually create IndepVarComps in the vast majority of cases.

Another new feature is the openmdao.api.slicer which helps specify src_indices for connections or indices for design variables, objectives, and constraints.
This is intended to allow the user to easily connect portions of an output to an input (such as selecting an individual column from a matrix, for instance).
The old method of providing an explicit list of indices should still work. However, the new slicer gives greater functionality since it allows for the use of general slicing syntax such as `om.slicer[0:10:1, :]`.
Using the slicer object is now considered the new best coding practice for giving src_indices or indices arguments.

We hope these changes will reduce the development burden on our users.
As this is a significant change, some issues may have slipped through our testing, and any feedback is always welcomed via issues on the GitHub repository.

## Backwards Incompatible API Changes:

- Fix a typo in user_terminate_signal option, deprecated the old. #1469
- Remove support for factorial function in ExecComp. #1483

## Backwards Incompatible NON-API Changes:

- _all_subsystem_iter has been removed.  Users should use the systems_iter method instead.

## New Features:

- N2 viewer changes to improve performance. #1475
- Local table of contents (navigation) added to docs sidebar. #1477
- N2 now uses coloring info by default to show dependence in each component. #1478
- Added test to capture error message when running in parallel with non distributed components. #1484
- N2 adds a spinner to give the user an indication when it isn't finished rendering. #1485
- All case recorder files now always contain system options information about all systems in the model. #1486
- Model data now compressed when saved in N2 HTML file. #1490
- Added support for om.slicer as a way to pass in slices to src_indices/indices arguments in add_design_var, add_response, add_constraint, promotes, and connect. #1491
- Added flag for `under_approx` to let the user know when a system is operating under any derivative approximation scheme, and a new counter `iter_count_without_approx`. #1492
- Allow the linear algebra components (DotProductComp, CrossProductComp, MatrixVectorProductComp, VectorMagnitudeComp) to each perform multiple calculations. #1503
- Automatically add a single, user-hidden, top-level IndepVarComp to provide outputs for every unconnected input in the model. #1539

## Bug Fixes:

- Fix bug where exception was raised while printing bounds violations via "print_bound_enforce" option on linesearch if one side of an output was unbounded. #1466
- Fixed an exception when using AddSubtractComp constructor instead of its add_equation method. #1474
- Minor fixes for Appveyor CI. #1495
- IndepVarComp did not use the options mechanism like other Components, which was an issue for a user that wanted to subclass it with additional options. #1536
- Problem.record() provides a useful error message if called before final_setup. #1545
- Fixed a bug that was obliterating options passed to BalanceComp, and added tests for better coverage. #1546
- Added quotes to install command in docs to prevent problems in some shell environments. #1547

# Release Notes for OpenMDAO 3.0.0

March 05, 2020

OpenMDAO 3.0.0 is the first version of OpenMDAO to drop support for Python 2.7.  Going forward,
we will support Python >= 3.6.  Functionally, 3.0.0 is identical to 2.10.1 with the exception
that long-standing deprecations have been removed and will now result in errors.

When upgrading to OpenMDAO 3.0.0, users should
1. Get their models working with version 2.10.1
2. Make necessary changes to remove any OpenMDAO-specific deprecation warnings
3. Upgrade to OpenMDAO 3.0.0 and verify that their models are working as expected.


## Backwards Incompatible API Changes:

The following are deprecated functionality since 2.0 that has been officially removed as of version 3.0.0:

- <POEM 004> AkimaSplineComp and BsplineComp have been **removed**, replaced with SplineComp.

- <POEM 008> The user is now **required** to set a value for the solver option `solve_subsystems`
    on Newton and Broyden solvers. Previously the default was `False`, but you would get
    a deprecation warning if this value was not explicitly set.

- The class for the PETSc linear solver `PetscKSP` is renamed `PetscKrylov`.

- The class for the Scipy linear solver `ScipyIterativeSolver` is renamed `ScipyKrylov`.

- The `NonLinearRunOnce` solver is now `NonlinearRunOnce`.

- The `FloatKrigingSurrogate` is now `KrigingSurrogate`.

- Optimizer `ScipyOptimizer` is now `ScipyOptimizeDriver`.

- API function and CLI command `view_model` are renamed `n2`.

- Component `ExternalCode` is renamed `ExternalCodeComp`.

- Component `KSComponent` is renamed `KSComp`.

- Component `MetaModelStructured` is renamed `MetaModelStructuredComp`.

- Component `MetaModel` is renamed `MetaModelUnStructuredComp`.

- Component `MultiFiMetaModel` is renamed `MultiFiMetaModelUnStructuredComp`.

- Case attribute `iteration_coordinate` is renamed `name`.

- Solver option `err_on_maxiter` is renamed `err_on_non_converge`.

- Solver attribute `preconditioner` is renamed `precon`.

- Nonlinear solver option `reraise_child_analysiserror` now defaults to False.

- BroydenSolver and NewtonSolver linesearch now defaults to BoundsEnforceLS.

- OptionsDictionary option argument `_type` is renamed `types`.

- Component attribute `distributed` has been changed to an option.

- The attribute `root` of Problem is renamed `model`.

- Group attribute `nl_solver` is renamed `nonlinear_solver`.

- Group attribute `ln_solver` is renamed `linear_solver`.

- System attribute `metadata` is renamed `options`.

- `units = 'unitless'` is removed.  Use `units = None` instead.

- NewtonSolver attribute `line_search` is now `linesearch`.

- Multi-variable specification via list or tuple to IndepVarComp is now invalid. Use add_output for each variable instead.

- Driver method `set_simul_deriv_color` is removed. Use `use_fixed_coloring` instead.

- Problem setup method argument `vector_class` removed. Use `distributed_vector_class` instead.

- pyOptSparseDriver method `dynamic_simul_derivs` removed. Use `declare_coloring` instead.

## Backwards Incompatible NON-API Changes:

Note: These changes are not technically API related, but
still may cause your results to differ when upgrading.

- <POEM 012> The old implementation of KrigingSurrogate was hard coded to the
  `gesdd` method for inverses. The method is now an option, but we've changed
  the default to `gesvd` because its more numerically stable.
  This might introduce slight numerical changes to the Kriging fits.

## New Features:

- None


## Bug Fixes:
- None

## Backwards Incompatible API Changes:

- <POEM 004> AkimaSplineComp and BsplineComp have been deprecated, replaced with SplineComp

- <POEM 008>
  - The user is now required to set a value for the solver option `solve_subsystems`

# Release Notes for OpenMDAO 2.9.1

October 8, 2019

2.9.1 is a quick patch release to correct a couple of issues:

## Bug Fixes:
- The previous release inadvertantly changed the default "bounds_enforce" option on the BoundsEnforce
  line search to "vector".  This release restores the default to the originally intended "scalar".
- The entry point for the `web_view` utility function was fixed. (Thank you Nicholas Bollweg)
- Fixed a bug that prevented model reconfigurability in certain situations.
- Fixed a missing `sqrt` in the documentation for the Hohmann example.
- Fixed a bug that prevented proper fallback from bidirectional coloring to unidirectional coloring
  in certain cases where the bidirectional coloring was worse than the unidirectional coloring.

## New Features:
- Small improvements were made to the MetaModel viewer, along with some additional testing.


***********************************
# Release Notes for OpenMDAO 2.9.0

October 1, 2019

## New Features:

- better detection of when you're running under MPI, and new environment variable to forcibly disable MPI
- users can now issue connections from within the `configure` method on group
  (this is useful if you wanted to be able to interrogate your children before issuing connections)
- significant overhead reduction due to switching from 'np.add.at' to 'np.bincount' for some matrix-vector
  products and data transfers.

- `openmdao` command line tool:
    - new `openmdao scaffold` command line tool to quickly bootstrap component and group files
    - `openmdao summary` command gives more data including number of constraints
    - `openmdao tree` command now uses different colors for implicit and explicit components and
      includes sizes of inputs and outputs
    - the `openmdao --help` tool gives better formatted help now

- CaseRecording:
    - Case objects now have a `name` attribute to make identifying them simpler
    - Case objects now support __getitem__ (i.e. <case>[<some_var>]) and the
      get_val/set_val methods to directly mimic the problem interface
    - list_inputs and list_outputs methods on Case objects now support optional includes and excludes patterns

- Documentation:
    - added documentation for the list_inputs and list_outputs method on the Case object
    - added example use of implicit component for add_discrete_input docs
    - some minor cleanup to the cantilever beam optimization example to remove some unused code

- Derivatives:
    - slightly different method of computing the total derivative sparsity pattern has been implemented
      that should be a bit more robust (but YMMV)
    - the partials object passed into `linearize` and `compute_partials` methods on implicit
      and explicit component respectively can now be iterated on like a true dictionary

- Solvers:
    - a true Goldstein condition was added to the ArmijoGoldstein line search
      (you can now choose if you want Armijo or Goldstein) *** Peter Onodi ***
    - DirectSolver now works under MPI
      (but be warned that it might be very slow to use it this way, because it does a lot of MPI communication!!!)
    - BroydenSolver now works in parallel
    - improved error message when you have a nonconverged solver
    - improved error message when solver failure is due to Nan or Inf

- Components:
    - list_inputs and list_outputs methods on System objects now support optional includes and excludes patterns
    - variables can now have tags added as additional meta-data when they are declared,
      which can then be used to filter the output from list_inputs and list_ouputs
    - significant speed improvements and increased surrogate options for StructuredMetaModel
    - improved error message when required options are not provided to a component during instantiation
    - user gets a clear error msg if they try to use `np.` or `numpy.` namespaces inside ExecComp strings
    - in the declare_coloring method, a threshold can now be set such that the generated coloring must improve
      things at least as much as the given percentage or the coloring will not be used. This can happen in cases
      where multiple instances of the same component class appear in a given model and each instance can potentially
      generate a different sparsity which results in a different coloring.

- Problem
    - user can set specific slices of variables using the set_val method on problem
    - added problem.compute_jacvec_prod function for matrix-free total derivative products.
      Useful for wrapping for loops around an OpenMDAO problem and propagating derivatives through it.

- Visualization
    - minor reformatting of the N2 menu to make better use of vertical screen space
    - new visualziation tool for examining the surrogates in StructuredMetaModelComp and UnstructuredMetaModelComp
    - improved `openmdao view_connections` functionality for better filtering and toggling between
      promoted and absolute names

  new methods 'linear' and 'cubic' have been added that are faster python implementations. 'quintic' is no longer used.

## Bug Fixes:
- `prom_name=True` now works with list_outputs on CaseReader (it was broken before)

    - Improved pathname information in the singular matrix error from DirectSolver
    - Directsolver has an improved error message when it detects identical rows or columns in Jacobian
    - NonlinearGaussSeidel solver now accounts for residual scaling in its convergence criterion

## Backwards Incompatible API Changes:
- New APIs for total derivative coloring that are more consistent with partial derivative coloring

# Release Notes for OpenMDAO 2.6.0

February 22, 2018

## New Features:
- MetaModelStructured will detect NaN in requested sample and print a readable message.
- ScipyOptimizeDriver now supports Hessian calculation option for optimizers that use it.
- User can specify src_indices that have duplicates or have two inputs on a single component connected to the same output, and still have CSC Jacobian work.
- User can get/set problem values in a straightforward manner: prob['var'] = 2., etc. even when running in parallel.
    - Problem 'get' access to distributed variables will raise an exception since it isn't clear what behavior is expected,
      i.e. should prob['comp.x'] return the full distributed variable or just the local part.
- Directsolver has an improved error message when it detects identical rows or columns in Jacobian.
- The NonlinearBlockGS solver has been updated with a less expensive implementation that does not call the compute method of Explicit components as many times.
- User can request a directional-derivative check (similar to SNOPTs built-in level 0 check) for check_partials.
- check_partials with compact_print will now always show all check pairs.
- The N^2 diagram (from `openmdao view_model`) now shows the solver hierarchy.
- KSComp has an improved, vectorized implementation.
- list_inputs now includes a 'shape' argument.
- User can generate an XDSM from a model (`openmdao xdsm`).

## Backwards Incompatible API Changes:
- The default bounds enforcement for BoundsEnforceLS is now 'scalar' (was 'vector')
- Direct solver will now use 'assemble_jac=True' by default
- Recording options 'includes' and 'excludes' now use promoted names for outputs (absolute path names are still used for inputs)
- FloatKrigingSurrogate has been deprecated since it does not provide any unique functionality.
- FloatMultifiKrigingSurrogate has been deleted because it was never used, was incorrectly implemented, and provides no new functionality.

##  Bug Fixes:
- Complex-step around Newton+DirectSolver now works with assembled Jacobians.
- Armijolinesearch implementation was incorrect when used with solve_subsystems. The implementation is now correct.

***********************************

- N2 viewer now includes tool tip (hover over) showing the promoted name of any variable.
- Improved error msg when building sparse partials with duplicate col/row entries.
- You can now build the docs without MPI/PETSc installed (you will get warnings, but no longer errors).
- Major internal refactor to reduce overhead on compute_totals calls (very noticeable on large design spaces but still cheap problems).
- Components now have a `under_complex_step` attribute you can check to see if complex-step is currently active.
- Components `distributed` attribute has been moved to an option (old attribute has been deprecated).
- MetaModelUnstructured will now use FD for partial derivatives of surrogates that don't provide analytic derivatives (user can override the default settings if they wish to use CS or different FD config).

- Parallel FD and CS at the component and group level is now supported.
- Can turn off the analytic derivative sub-system if it is not needed via an argument to setup().
- Derivative coloring now works for problems that run under MPI.

## Backwards Incompatible API Changes:
-- `get_objectives` method on CaseReader now returns a dict-like object.
- Output vector is now locked (read-only) when inside the `apply_nonlinear` method (you shouldn't have been changing it then anyway!).
- default step size for complex-step has been changed to 1e-40.
- Moderate refactor of the CaseReader API. It is now self-consistent.

# Release Notes for OpenMDAO 2.4.0

August 1, 2018

## New Features:
- Better error message when upper and lower have the wrong shape for add_design_var and add_constraint methods.
- pyOptSparseDriver now runs the initial condition for ALPSO and NSGA-II optimizers.
- Normalization in EQConstraintComp and BalanceComp is now optional.

- New Components in the standard library:
    - VectorMagnitudeComp

- New Solvers in the standard library:
    - BroydenSolver

- New CaseRecording/CaseReading Features:
    - <Problem>.load_case() method lets you pull values from a case back into the problem.
    - Updated the Case recording format for better performance.
    - User can call <Problem>.record_iteration() to save specific cases.
      Recording options for this method are separate from driver/solver options.
      This is so you can record one (or more) cases manually with *ALL* the variables in it if you want to.

## Backwards Incompatible API Changes:
- The input and output vectors are now put into read-only modes within certain component methods.
  NOTE: This REALLY REALLY should not break anyone's models, but it is technically a backwards-incompatible change...
        If you were changing values in these arrays when you shouldn't have been, you're going to get an error now.
        Fix it... the new error is enforcing correct behavior.
        If it was working before, you got lucky.

## Bug Fixes:
- Various small bug fixes to check_partials and check_totals.
- ArmijoGoldstein linesearch iteration counter works correctly now.
- the record_derivatives recorder_option now actually does something!

# Release Notes for OpenMDAO 2.3.1

June 20, 2018


2.3.1 is a quick patch release to correct/update a few release-supporting documents such as the 2.3.0 release notes.
However, a few new features did manage to sneak in:


## New Features:
- Support for simultaneous derivatives in reverse mode.
- Added a '-m' option (possible values 'fwd' and 'rev') to the 'openmdao simul_coloring' command to allow coloring in either direction.
- Users are now warned during 'check_config' if no recorders are defined.

***********************************
# Release Notes for OpenMDAO 2.3.0

June 12, 2018

## New Features:
- Drivers have new `debug_print` option that writes design vars, objective, and constraints to stdout for each iteration.

- Added a DOEDriver for serial and parallel cases to the standard library.
    (For people who had adopted DOEDriver early, via github, the following things have changed since initial implementation:)
    - The option that controls the parallel behavior for DOEDriver was changed to `procs_per_model` from `parallel`.
    - User can provide a CSV file to the DOEDriver to run an arbitrary set of cases.

- Solvers have new `debug_print` option that will report the initial condition of the solver if it fails to converge.

- SimpleGADriver changes:
    - Will now compute a population size based on 4*sum(bits) + 1 if pop_size=0.
    - Can support models that need more than one processor.

- Problem changes:
    - New Problem methods `<problem>.get_val()` and `<problem>.set_val()` allow the user to specify a unit, and we'll convert to the correct unit (or throw an error if the unit is not compatible).
    - `list_problem_vars()` method will report all design vars, objectives, and constraints.

- OpenMDAO command line utility now works under MPI.
- ExternalCodeComp has new option, `allowed_return_codes` to specify valid return codes.
- Components that request complex-step for partial derivative checks will now fall back to finite-difference if `force_alloc_complex=False`.
- You can now pass a case_prefix argument to run_model or run_driver to name the cases for case recording.
- Beam example problem now runs 20x faster.

- New Analytic Derivatives Features
    - Major re-write of the Feature documentation on the Core Feature, "Working with Analytic Derivatives."
    - User can now set AssembledJacobians for linear solvers. (Big speedup for a lot of lower-order or serial problems).
    - Automatic calculation of total Jacobian sparsity for fwd derivatives for optimizers that support it (lower compute cost when using SNOPT).
    - Automatic simultaneous coloring algorithm for separable problems to speed up derivatives calculations.
    - Option for caching of linear solution vectors to speed up linear solves when using iterative solvers.
    - check_partials now allows you to use `includes` and `excludes` to limit which components get checked.

- New Components in the standard library:
    - CrossProductComp
    - DotProductComp
    - MatrixVectorProductComp
    - ExternalCodeImplicitComp
    - EQConstraintComp

- Updates to existing Components in standard library:
    - LinearSystemComp has been vectorized.
    - KSComp has been vectorized.
    - BsplineComp has been vectorized.

- New CaseRecording/CaseReading Features:
    - CaseRecorder now saves metadata/options from all groups and components.
    - CaseReader now supports `list_inputs` and `list_outputs` methods.
    - User can iterate over cases from a CaseReader in either flat or hierarchical modes.
    - User can re-load a case back into a model via the `load_case()` method.


## Backwards-Compatible API Changes:
- Changed all instances of `metadata` to `options`. `<system>.metadata` has now been deprecated.

- Class name changes to Components, so all end in "Comp" (old class names have been deprecated):
    - MetaModelStructured -> MetaModelStructuredComp
    - MetaModelUnStructured -> MetaModelUnStructuredComp
    - MultiFiMetaModelUnStructured -> MultiFiMetaModelUnStructuredComp
    - ExternalCode -> ExternalCodeComp

- Driver metadata/options can now be set via init args (can still be set as options as well).
- User no longer needs to specify PETSCvector for parallel cases (the framework figures it out now).

- check_totals and check_partials no longer support the `supress_output` argument. Use `out_stream=None` instead.


## Backwards-Incompatible API Changes:
- `comps` argument in check_partials was replaced with `includes` and `excludes` arguments.
- Re-design of the CaseReader API. Unification of all cases, and simpler iteration over case hierarchies.
- `partial_type` argument for LinearSystemComponent has been removed
- `maxiter` option from BoundsEnforceLS has been removed

## Bug Fixes:
- Fixed bug in component-level FD that caused it to call the model too many times.
- Added proper error check for situation when user creates a variable name containing illegal characters.
- Better error msg when adding objectives or constraints with variables that don't exist under MPI execution.
- Vectorization for MetaModelUnStructuredComp was super-duper broken. It's fixed now.


***********************************
# Release Notes for OpenMDAO 2.2.1

April 2, 2018

## New Features:
- check_partials() improvements to formatting and clarity. Report of potentially-bad derivatives summarized at bottom of output.
- check_partials() only compares fwd analytic to FD for any components that provide derivatives directly through the Jacobian
    argument to compute_partials or linearize. (significantly less output to view now).
- Docs for UnstructuredMetaModel improved.
- pyoptsparse wrapper only calls run_model before optimization if LinearConstraints are included.
- ScipyOptimizerDriver is now smarter about how it handles linear constraints. It caches the derivatives and doesn't recompute them anymore.
- Docs for ExternalCode improved to show how to handle derivatives.
- cache_linear_solution argument to add_design_var, add_constraint, add_objective, allows iterative linear solves to use previous solution as initial guess.
- New solver debugging tool via the `debug_print` option: writes out initial state values, so failed cases can be more easily replicated.
- Added generic KS component.
- Added generic Bspline component.
- Improved error msg when class is passed into add_subsystem.
- Automated Jacobian coloring algorithm now works across all variables (previously, it was just local within a variable).
- Major refactor of the `compute_totals` method to clean up and simplify.

## Backwards-Compatible API Changes:
N/A

## Backwards-Incompatible API changes:
N/A

## Bug Fixes:
- compute_totals works without any arguments now (just uses the default set of des_vars, objectives, and constraints)
- UnstructuredMetaModel can now be sub-classed
- Deprecated ScipyOptimizer class wasn't working correctly, but can now actually be used.

- `list_outputs` method updated with new display options, ability to filter variables by residual value, ability to change sorting scheme, and ability to display unit details.
- openmdao citation helper added to the `openmdao` command line script, making it easy to generate the correct bibtex citations based on which classes are being used.
- `NewtonSolver` modified so that maxiter=0 case now will compute residuals, but not do a linear solve (useful for debugging nonlinear errors).

## Backwards-Compatible API Changes:
- Changed `ScipyOptimizer` to `ScipyOptimizeDriver` for consistency (deprecated older class).

- `types_` argument to `self.metadata.declare` changed to `types`. (old argument deprecated)
- `types` and `values` arguments to `self.metadata.declare`
