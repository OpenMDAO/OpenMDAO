The Theory Manual exists to explain some of the underlying concepts behind OpenMDAO in more detail.
It is not intended to show you how to use any specific features of OpenMDAO, but rather to
understand why you might choose to use a feature. It provides information in a more theoretical and
mathematical manner to help users gain a deeper understanding of how the framework operates.
