Advanced User Guide
********************

These tutorials cover more advanced topics.
This guide assumes that you have read the :ref:`Basic User Guide <UserGuide>`, and
it builds from those basics to cover more complex topics that will let you get the most out of the framework.
Within each section, the tutorials are designed to be read in order, but each section is self-contained enough
that you can choose to read only the sections that are useful to you.


.. _implicit_model_tutorial:

----------------------------------
Models with Implicit Components
----------------------------------

Lots of analyses, such as the mach-area relationship, circuit analysis, finite element models, and CFD, make use of an implicit formulation.
This tutorial shows you how to define implicit components and integrate those components into larger models.
It also shows you how to use OpenMDAO's nonlinear Newton solver to converge the models.
