*******************************
In-Memory Assembly of Jacobians
*******************************

When you have groups, or entire models, that are small enough to fit the entire Jacobian into memory,
you can have OpenMDAO actually assemble the partial-derivative Jacobian in memory.
In many cases this can yield a substantial speed up over the default,
:ref:`matrix-free<theory_assembled_vs_matrix_free>` implementation in OpenMDAO.

.. note::
    Assembled Jacobians are especially effective when you have a deeply-nested hierarchy with a
    large number of components and/or variables. See the
    :ref:`Theory Manual entry on assembled Jacobians<theory_assembled_vs_matrix_free>` for more
    details on how to best select which type of Jacobian to use.


To use an assembled Jacobian, you set the :code:`assemble_jac` option of the linear solver that
will own it to True.  The type of the assembled jacobian will be determined by the value of
:code:`options['assembled_jac_type']` in the solver's containing system.
There are two options of 'assembled_jac_type' to choose from, `dense` and `csc`.  For example:

.. code-block:: python

    model.options['assembled_jac_type'] = 'dense'
    model.linear_solver = DirectSolver(assemble_jac=True)


'csc' is the default, and you should try that first if you're not sure of which one to use.
Most problems, even if they have dense sub-Jacobians from each component, are fairly sparse at
the model level and the
:ref:`DirectSolver<directsolver>` will usually be much faster with a sparse factorization.

.. note::

   You are allowed to use multiple assembled Jacobians at multiple different levels of your model hierarchy.
   This may be useful if you have nested non-linear solvers to converge very difficult problems.

Usage Example
-------------

In the following example, borrowed from the :ref:`newton solver tutorial<defining_icomps_tutorial>`,
we assemble the Jacobian at the same level of the model hierarchy as the :ref:`NewtonSolver<nlnewton>`
and :ref:`DirectSolver<directsolver>`. In general, you will always do the assembly at the same level
as the linear solver that will make use of the Jacobian matrix.
