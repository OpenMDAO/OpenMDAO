*************************************************************
Simultaneous Total Derivative Coloring For Separable Problems
*************************************************************

When OpenMDAO solves for total derivatives, it loops over either design variables in 'fwd' mode
or responses in 'rev' mode.  For each of those variables, it performs a linear solve for each
member of that variable, so for a scalar variable there would be only a single linear solve, and
there would be *N* solves for an array variable of size *N*.


Certain problems have a special kind of sparsity structure in the total derivative Jacobian that
allows OpenMDAO to solve for multiple derivatives simultaneously. This can result in far fewer
linear solves and much-improved performance. These problems are said to have separable variables.
The concept of separability is explained in the :ref:`Theory Manual<theory_separable_variables>`.

Simultaneous derivative coloring in OpenMDAO can be performed either statically or dynamically.

When mode is set to 'fwd' or 'rev', a unidirectional coloring algorithm is used to group columns
or rows, respectively, for simultaneous derivative calculation.  The algorithm used in this case
is the greedy algorithm with ordering by incidence degree found in
T. F. Coleman and J. J. More, *Estimation of sparse Jacobian matrices and graph coloring
problems*, SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 20 (1983), pp. 187–209.

When using simultaneous derivatives, setting `mode='auto'` will indicate that bidirectional coloring
should be used.  Bidirectional coloring can significantly decrease the number of linear solves needed
to generate the total Jacobian relative to coloring only in fwd or rev mode.

For more information on the bidirectional coloring algorithm, see
T. F. Coleman and A. Verma, *The efficient computation of sparse Jacobian matrices using automatic
differentiation*, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 19 (1998), pp. 1210–1233.

.. note::

    Bidirectional coloring is a new feature and should be considered *experimental* at this
    point.


The OpenMDAO algorithms use the sparsity patterns for the partial derivatives given by the
:ref:`declare_partials <feature_sparse_partials>` calls from all of the components in your model.
So you should :ref:`specify the sparsity of the partial derivatives<feature_sparse_partials>`
of your components in order to make it possible to find a better automatic coloring.


Dynamic Coloring
================

Dynamic coloring computes the derivative colors at runtime, shortly after the driver begins the
optimization.  This has the advantage of simplicity and robustness to changes in the model, but
adds the cost of the coloring computation to the run time of the optimization.  Generally, however,
this cost will be small relative to the cost of the full optimization unless your total jacobian
is very large.

Activating dynamic coloring is simple.  Just call the `declare_coloring` function on the driver.
For example:

.. code-block:: python

    prob.driver.declare_coloring()


If you want to change the number of `compute_totals` calls that the coloring algorithm uses to
compute the jacobian sparsity (default is 3), the tolerance used to determine nonzeros
(default is 1e-25), you can pass the `num_full_jacs`, and `tol` args.
You can also pass the `min_improve_pct` arg, which specifies how much the coloring must
reduce the number of linear solves required to generate the total jacobian else coloring will
be deactivated.

For example:

.. code-block:: python

    prob.driver.declare_coloring(num_full_jacs=2, tol=1e-20, min_improve_pct=10.)


If you want to perform a tolerance sweep, trying out a range of tolerances when determining
what values of the sparsity matrix should be considered zero, then you can set the `orders`
arg.  OpenMDAO will then sweep over tolerances from the given `tol` plus and minus `orders`
orders of magnitude.  For each tolerance, it checks the number of nonzero values, and chooses
a tolerance from the largest group of tolerances that share the same number of nonzeros. If
it can't find at least two tolerances that result in the same number of nonzeros, an exception
is raised.

Here's an example:


.. code-block:: python

    prob.driver.declare_coloring(tol=1e-35, orders=20)


Whenever a dynamic coloring is computed, the coloring is written to a file called
*total_coloring.pkl* for later 'static' use.  The file will be written in a directory specified
in :code:`problem.options['coloring_dir']`. If no value is set into
:code:`problem.options['coloring_dir']` then the *coloring_files* directory under the current working
directory at the time the problem is instantiated will be used.


You can see a more complete example of setting up an optimization with
simultaneous derivatives in the
:ref:`Simple Optimization using Simultaneous Derivatives <simul_deriv_example>` example.


.. _feature_automatic_coloring:

Static Coloring
===============

To get rid of the runtime cost of computing the coloring, you can precompute it and tell the
driver to use its precomputed coloring by calling the :code:`use_fixed_coloring` method on the
driver.  Note that this call should be made *after* calling :code:`declare_coloring`.


.. automethod:: openmdao.core.driver.Driver.use_fixed_coloring
    :noindex:


You don't need to tell :code:`use_fixed_coloring` the name of the coloring file to use,
because it uses a fixed name, `total_coloring.pkl`, and knows what directory to look in based on
the directory specified in :code:`problem.options['coloring_dir']`.  However, you *can* pass
the name of a coloring file to :code:`use_fixed_coloring` if you want to use a specific coloring
file that doesn't follow the standard naming convention.

While using a precomputed coloring has the advantage of removing the runtime cost of computing
the coloring, it should be used with care, because any changes in the model, design variables, or
responses can make the existing coloring invalid.  If *any* configuration changes have been
made to the optimization, it's recommended to regenerate the coloring before re-running the optimization.


The total coloring can be regenerated and written to the `total_coloring.pkl` file in
a directory determined by the value of :code:`problem.options['coloring_files']` using the
following command:

.. code-block:: none

    openmdao total_coloring <your_script_name>


Note that if you have passed a coloring filename into :code:`use_fixed_coloring` instead of
letting the framework determine the filename automatically, the framework will not update
the contents of the coloring file even if you run :code:`openmdao total_coloring` from the
command line.

The total_coloring command also generates summary information that can sometimes be useful.
The tolerance that was actually used to determine if an entry in the total jacobian is
considered to be non-zero is displayed, along with the number of zero entries found in this
case, and how many times that number of zero entries occurred when sweeping over different tolerances
between +- a number of orders of magnitude around the given tolerance.  If no tolerance is given, the default
is 1e-15.  If the number of occurrences is only 1, an exception will be raised, and you should
increase the number of total derivative computations that the algorithm uses to compute the
sparsity pattern.  You can do that with the *-n* option.  The following, for example, will
perform the total derivative computation *5* times.

.. code-block:: none

    openmdao total_coloring <your_script_name> -n 5


Note that when multiple total jacobian computations are performed, we take the absolute values
of each jacobian and add them together, then divide by number of jacobians computed, resulting
in the average of absolute values of each entry.

If repeating the total derivative computation multiple times doesn't work, try changing the
tolerance using the *-t* option as follows:

.. code-block:: none

    openmdao total_coloring <your_script_name> -n 5 -t 1e-10


Be careful when setting the tolerance, however, because if you make it too large then you may be
zeroing out Jacobian entries that should not be ignored and your optimization may not converge.


If you want to examine the sparsity structure of your total jacobian, you can use the *--view*
option as follows:


.. code-block:: none

    openmdao total_coloring <your_script_name> --view


which will display a visualization of the sparsity
structure with rows and columns labelled with the response and design variable names, respectively.
See the figure :ref:`here <fig-coloring-view>`.


A text-based view is also available using the `--textview` arg.  For example:


.. code-block:: none

    openmdao total_coloring <your_script_name> --textview


will display something like the following:


.. code-block:: none

    ....................f 0  circle.area
    f.........f.........f 1  r_con.g
    .f.........f........f 2  r_con.g
    ..f.........f.......f 3  r_con.g
    ...f.........f......f 4  r_con.g
    ....f.........f.....f 5  r_con.g
    .....f.........f....f 6  r_con.g
    ......f.........f...f 7  r_con.g
    .......f.........f..f 8  r_con.g
    ........f.........f.f 9  r_con.g
    .........f.........ff 10  r_con.g
    f.........f.......... 11  theta_con.g
    ..f.........f........ 12  theta_con.g
    ....f.........f...... 13  theta_con.g
    ......f.........f.... 14  theta_con.g
    ........f.........f.. 15  theta_con.g
    ff........ff......... 16  delta_theta_con.g
    ..ff........ff....... 17  delta_theta_con.g
    ....ff........ff..... 18  delta_theta_con.g
    ......ff........ff... 19  delta_theta_con.g
    ........ff........ff. 20  delta_theta_con.g
    f.................... 21  l_conx.g
    |indeps.x
              |indeps.y
                        |indeps.r

Note that the design variables are displayed along the bottom of the matrix, with a pipe symbol (|)
that lines up with the starting column for that variable.  Also, an 'f' indicates a nonzero value
that is colored in 'fwd' mode, while an 'r' indicates a nonzero value colored in 'rev' mode.  A
'.' indicates a zero value.


The coloring file will be written in pickle format to the standard location and will be loaded
using the *use_fixed_coloring* function like this:


.. code-block:: python

    prob.driver.use_fixed_coloring()


Note that there are two ways to generate files that can be loaded using `use_fixed_coloring`.
You can either run the `openmdao total_coloring` command line tool, or you can just run your
model, and as long as you've called `declare_coloring` on your driver, it will automatically
generate a coloring file that you can 'lock in' at some later point by adding a call to
`use_fixed_coloring`, after you're done making changes to your model.


If you have a coloring file that was generated earlier and you want to view its statistics,
you can use the `openmdao view_coloring` command to generate a small report.

.. code-block:: none

    openmdao view_coloring <your_coloring_file> -m


will show metadata associated with the creation of the coloring along with a short summary.
For example:


.. code-block:: none

    Coloring metadata:
    {'orders': 20, 'num_full_jacs': 3, 'tol': 1e-15}

    Jacobian shape: (22, 21)  (13.42% nonzero)

    FWD solves: 5   REV solves: 0

    Total colors vs. total size: 5 vs 21  (76.2% improvement)

    Time to compute sparsity: 0.024192 sec.
    Time to compute coloring: 0.001076 sec.


Adding a `--view` arg will pop up an interactive plot showing the coloring of the jacobian. Forward
colors will be colored blue/green and reverse colors will be colored red/yellow.  Clicking on
a particular cell of the jacobian will display the location, the color number, the coloring direction,
and the particular 'of' and 'wrt' variables for that particular sub-jacobian.  Note that this
viewer requires the installation of matplotlib. See the figure below.

.. _fig-coloring-view:


.. figure:: coloring_viewer.png
   :align: center
   :width: 500 px
   :alt: Coloring viewer example


If matplotlib is not available, a text-based version of the jacobian can be printed using the
`--textview` arg.


.. note::

    Your coloring file(s) will be found in the standard directory
    `problem.options['coloring_dir']`.  That directory may contain a total coloring
    file, `total_coloring.pkl`, in additon to files containing partial derivative colorings for
    particular component classes or instances, as well as semi-total derivative coloring files
    for particular groups.


If you run *openmdao total_coloring* and it turns out there is no simultaneous total coloring
available, or that you don't gain very much by coloring, don't be surprised.  Not all total
Jacobians are sparse enough to benefit significantly from simultaneous derivatives.


Checking that it works
######################

After activating simultaneous derivatives, you should check your total
derivatives using the :ref:`check_totals <check-total-derivatives>` function.
The algorithm that we use still has a small chance of
computing an incorrect coloring due to the possibility that the total Jacobian being analyzed
by the algorithm contained one or more zero values that are only incidentally zero.
Using :code:`check_totals` is the way to be sure that something hasn't
gone wrong.

If you used the automatic coloring algorithm, and you find that :code:`check_totals`
is reporting incorrect total derivatives, then you should try using the *-n* and *-t* options
mentioned earlier until you get the correct total derivatives.
