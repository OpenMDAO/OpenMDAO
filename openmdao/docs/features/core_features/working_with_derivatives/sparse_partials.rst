Sparse Partial Derivatives
**************************

When a partial derivative is sparse (few nonzero entries compared to the total size of the matrix),
it may be advantageous to utilize a format that stores only the nonzero entries. To use sparse
partial derivatives, they must first be declared with the sparsity pattern in
:code:`setup_partials` using the :code:`declare_partials` method.

Usage
-----

1. To specify the sparsity pattern in the AIJ format (alternatively known as COO format), use the :code:`rows` and :code:`cols` arguments
to :code:`declare_partials`. For example, to declare a sparsity pattern of nonzero
entries in the (0, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), and (1,3) positions, one would use
:code:`rows=[0, 1, 1, 1], cols=[0, 1, 2, 3]`. When using :code:`compute_partials`, you do not
need to pass the sparsity pattern again. Instead, you simply give the values for the entries in the
same order as given in :code:`declare_partials`.

2. If only some of your Jacobian entries change across iterations, or if you wish to avoid creating intermediate arrays, you may update the entries in-place.

3. If your partial derivative is constant and sparse, or if you simply wish to provide an initial value for the derivative, you can pass in the values using the :code:`val` argument. If you are using the AIJ format, :code:`val` should receive the nonzero entries in the same order as given for :code:`rows` and :code:`cols`. Alternatively, you may provide a Scipy sparse matrix, from which the sparsity pattern is deduced.
