****************
Setup Your Model
****************

After you have built a model by defining variables and components, organizing them into a
hierarchy, and connecting them together you then need to call the :code:`setup()` method to have
the framework do some initialization work in preparation for execution.
You can control some details of that initialization with the arguments that you pass into :code:`setup()`,
and it is important to note that you cannot set or get any variable values, nor run until **after**
you call :code:`setup()`.
