DotProductComp
**************

`DotProductComp` performs a dot-product between two compatible inputs.  It may be vectorized to provide the result at one or more points simultaneously.

.. math::

    c_i = \bar{a}_i \cdot \bar{b}_i

The default `vec_size` is 1, providing the dot product of :math:`a` and :math:`b` at a single
point.  The lengths of :math:`a` and :math:`b` are provided by option `length`.

Options for DotProductComp allow the user to rename the input variables :math:`a` and :math:`b`
and the output :math:`c`, as well as specifying their units.

    metadata

In the following example DotProductComp is used to compute instantaneous power as the
dot product of force and velocity at 100 points simultaneously.  Note the use of
`a_name`, `b_name`, and `c_name` to assign names to the inputs and outputs.
Units are assigned using `a_units`, `b_units`, and `c_units`.
Note that no internal checks are performed to ensure that `c_units` are consistent
with `a_units` and `b_units`.
