ExternalCodeComp

ExternalCodeComp is a component that runs an external program in a subprocess on your operating system.

If external programs do not have Python APIs, it is necessary to "file wrap" them.
`ExternalCodeComp` is a utility component that makes file wrapping easier by
taking care of the mundane tasks associated with executing the external application.
These include:

- Making the system call using the Subprocess module
- Redirecting `stdin, stdout,` and `stderr` to the user's specification
- Capturing error codes
- Defining environment variables
- Handling timeout and polling
- Running the code on a remote server if required

ExternalCodeComp Options

ExternalCodeComp Constructor
----------------------------

The call signature for the `ExternalCodeComp` constructor is:

.. automethod:: openmdao.components.external_code_comp.ExternalCodeComp.__init__

ExternalCodeComp Example
------------------------

In this example we will give an example based on a common scenario of a code that takes
its inputs from an input file, performs some computations, and then writes the results
to an output file. `ExternalCodeComp` supports multiple input and output files but
for simplicity, this example only uses one of each.  Also, for the purposes of this
example we have kept the input and output files as simple as possible. In practice,
the data will likely be organized in some defined way and thus some care must be taken
to read and write the data as dictated by the file format. OpenMDAO provides a set
of :ref:`File Wrapping <filewrap_feature>` tools to help with this.


.. note::

  To make it easy for you to run our example external code in any operating system or environment,
  we built it as a Python script that evaluates the paraboloid
  equation. We'll just call this script like any other executable, even though it is a Python script,
  and could be turned directly an OpenMDAO `Component`. Just keep in mind that any external code will
  work here, not just python scripts!

Here is the script for this external code. It simply reads its inputs, `x` and `y`, from an external file,
does the same computation as the :ref:`Paraboloid Tutorial <tutorial_paraboloid_analysis>` and writes the output,
`f_xy`, to an output file.


.. embed-code::
    openmdao.components.tests.extcode_paraboloid


The following example demonstrates how to build an OpenMDAO component that makes use of this external code.

.. note::
    If you pass a string as a command, OpenMDAO sets `shell=True` which can add `overhead <https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#frequently-used-arguments>`_ leading to
    a decrease in performance and a security `loophole <https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#security-considerations>`_. Use list when possible.

.. embed-code::
    openmdao.components.tests.test_external_code_comp.ParaboloidExternalCodeComp


We will go through each section and explain how this code works.

OpenMDAO provides a base class, `ExternalCodeComp`, which you should inherit from to
build your wrapper components. Just like any other component, you will define the
necessary inputs and outputs in the `setup` method.
If you want the component to check to make sure any files exist before/after you run,
then you can set the `external_input_files` and `external_output_files`, respectively.
You'll also define the command that should be called by the external code.

.. embed-code::
    openmdao.components.tests.test_external_code_comp.ParaboloidExternalCodeComp.setup


The `compute` method is responsible for calculating outputs for a
given set of inputs. When running an external code, this means
you have to take the parameter values and push them down into files,
run your code, then pull the output values back up. So there is some Python
code needed to do all that file writing, reading, and parsing.

.. embed-code::
    openmdao.components.tests.test_external_code_comp.ParaboloidExternalCodeComp.compute


`ParaboloidExternalCodeComp` is now complete. All that is left is to actually use it in a model.

.. embed-code::
    openmdao.components.tests.test_external_code_comp.TestExternalCodeCompFeature.test_main
    :layout: interleave


Using ExternalCodeComp in an Optimization
-----------------------------------------

If you are going to use an ExternalCodeComp component in a gradient based optimization, you'll need to
get its :ref:`partial derivatives<advanced_guide_partial_derivs_explicit>` somehow.
One way would be just to use :ref:`finite-difference approximations<feature_declare_partials_approx>` for the partials.

In the following example, the `ParaboloidExternalCodeComp` component has been modified to specify
that partial derivatives are approximiated via finite difference.

.. embed-code::
    openmdao.components.tests.test_external_code_comp.ParaboloidExternalCodeCompFD

Now we can perform an optimization using the external code, as shown here:

.. embed-code::
    openmdao.components.tests.test_external_code_comp.TestExternalCodeCompFeature.test_optimize_fd
    :layout: interleave

Alternatively, if the code you are wrapping happens to provide analytic derivatives you could
have those written out to a file and then parse that file in the
:ref:`compute_partials<comp-type-2-explicitcomp>` method.

Here is a version of our external script that writes its derivatives to a second output file:

.. embed-code::
    openmdao.components.tests.extcode_paraboloid_derivs

And the corresponding `ParaboloidExternalCodeCompDerivs` component:

.. embed-code::
    openmdao.components.tests.test_external_code_comp.ParaboloidExternalCodeCompDerivs

Again, we can perform an optimization using the external code with derivatives:

.. embed-code::
    openmdao.components.tests.test_external_code_comp.TestExternalCodeCompFeature.test_optimize_derivs
    :layout: interleave
