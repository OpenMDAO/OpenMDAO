Driver Recording
*****************

A :class:`CaseRecorder<openmdao.recorders.case_recorder.CaseRecorder>` is commonly attached to the
problemâ€™s Driver in order to gain insight into the convergence of the model as the driver finds a
solution. By default, a recorder attached to a driver will record the design variables, constraints
and objectives.
