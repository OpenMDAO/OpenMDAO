System Recording
---------------------------

If you need to focus on a smaller part of your model, it may be useful to attach a case recorder to
a particular :code:`System`. There are slightly different options when recording from these objects.
System recording can only be used in serial running environments and cannot currently be used in parallel.

System Recording Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. embed-options::
    openmdao.core.system

.. note::
    Note that the :code:`excludes` option takes precedence over the :code:`includes` option.
