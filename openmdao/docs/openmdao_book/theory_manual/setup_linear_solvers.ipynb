    "# Setting Up a Model for Efficient Linear Solves\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of different features that you can use to control how the linear solves are performed that will have an impact on both the speed and accuracy of the linear solution.\n",
    "A deeper understanding of how OpenMDAO solves the unified derivatives equations is useful in understanding when to apply certain features, and may also help you structure your model to make the most effective use of these features.\n",
    "The explanation of OpenMDAO's features for improving linear solver performance are broken up into three sections below:\n",
    "\n",
    "(determining_what_kind_of_linear_solver_to_use)=\n",
    "## Determining What Kind of Linear Solver to Use\n",
    "\n",
    "Since total derivatives are computed by solving the unified derivatives equations, there is always some kind of linear solver used by the framework whenever [compute_totals](../features/core_features/working_with_derivatives/approximating_totals.ipynb) is called.\n",
    "However, the specific type of linear solver that should be used will vary greatly depending on the underlying model structure.\n",
    "The most basic distinguishing feature of a model that governs what kind of linear solver should be used is the presence of any coupling.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Uncoupled Models\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a completely uncoupled model, then the partial-derivative Jacobian matrix will have a lower-triangular structure.\n",
    "The resulting linear system can be solved using a block-forward or block-backward substitution algorithm.\n",
    "Alternatively you could view the solution algorithm as a single iteration of a block Gauss-Seidel algorithm.\n",
    "In OpenMDAO, the single-pass block Gauss-Seidel algorithm is implemented via the [LinearRunOnce](../features/building_blocks/solvers/linear_runonce.ipynb) solver.\n",
    "This is the default solver used by OpenMDAO on all [Groups](../features/core_features/working_with_groups/main.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "![uncoupled_fwd](images/matrix_figs/uncoupled_fwd.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "<div align=\"center\"><b>The linear system for an uncoupled system can be solved with forward substitution in forward mode</b></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using *reverse* mode, then the left-hand side of the unified derivatives equations will be the transpose-Jacobian and will have an upper-triangular structure.\n",
    "The upper-triangular transpose-Jacobian structure is notable, because it can also be seen in the [n2 diagram](../other_useful_docs/om_command.ipynb) that OpenMDAO can produce.\n",
    "\n",
    "![uncoupled_rev](images/matrix_figs/uncoupled_rev.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "<div align=\"center\"><b>The linear system for an uncoupled system can be solved with back substitution in reverse mode.</b></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Coupled Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Coupled models will always have a non-triangular structure to their partial-derivative Jacobian.\n",
    "In other words, there will be nonzero entries both above and below the diagonal.\n",
    "\n",
    "![coupled_fwd](images/matrix_figs/coupled_fwd.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "<div align=\"center\"><b>The linear system of a coupled model must be solved using either a direct factorization or an iterative linear solver.</b></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, these linear systems **cannot** be solved with the [LinearRunOnce](../features/building_blocks/solvers/linear_runonce.ipynb) solver.\n",
    "There are two basic categories of linear solver that can be used in this situation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Direct solvers (e.g. [DirectSolver](../features/building_blocks/solvers/direct_solver.ipynb))\n",
    "2. Iterative solvers (e.g. [LinearBlockGS](../features/building_blocks/solvers/linear_block_gs.ipynb), [ScipyKrylov](../features/building_blocks/solvers/scipy_iter_solver.ipynb))\n",
    "\n",
    "Direct solvers make use of the Jacobian matrix, assembled in memory, in order to compute an inverse or a factorization that can be used to solve the linear system.\n",
    "Conversely, iterative linear solvers find the solution to the linear system without ever needing to access the Jacobian matrix directly.\n",
    "They search for solution vectors that drive the linear residual to 0 using only matrix-vector products.\n",
    "The key idea is that **some** kind of linear solver is needed when there is coupling in your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which type of solver is best for your model use is heavily case-dependent and sometimes can be a difficult question to answer absolutely.\n",
    "However, there are a few rules of thumb that can be used to guide most cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Direct solvers are very simple to use, and for smaller problems, are likely to be the best option. The only downside is that the cost of computing the factorization scales is $n^3$, where $n$ is the length of your variable vector, so the compute cost can get out of control. If $n$ < 2000, try this solver first.\n",
    "2. Iterative solvers are more difficult to use because they do not always succeed in finding a good solution to the linear problem. Often times they require preconditioners in order to be effective. However, with adequate preconditioning, iterative solvers can dramatically outperform direct solvers for even moderate-sized problems. The trade-off you make is computational speed for complexity in getting the solver to work. Iterative solvers can also offer significant memory savings, since there isn't a need to allocate one large matrix for all the partials.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "There is a relationship between linear and nonlinear solvers. Any coupling in your model will affect both the linear and nonlinear solves, and thus impact which type of linear and nonlinear solvers you use.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the most basic case, an uncoupled model will use the default [NonLinearRunOnce](../features/building_blocks/solvers/nonlinear_runonce.ipynb) and the [LinearRunOnce](../features/building_blocks/solvers/linear_runonce.ipynb) solvers. These *RunOnce* solvers are a special degenerate class of Solver, which can't handle any kind of coupling or implicitness in a model. Any model with coupling will require an iterative nonlinear solver. Any model that requires an iterative nonlinear solver will also need a linear solver other than the default [LinearRunOnce](../features/building_blocks/solvers/linear_runonce.ipynb) solver.\n",

    "(theory-assembled-vs-matrix-free)=\n",
    "## Selecting Linear Solver Architecture: Dense, Sparse, or Matrix-Free\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadly speaking, there are two classes of linear solver architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Assembled Jacobian\n",
    "- Matrix-free\n",
    "\n",
    "At any level of the hierarchy in an OpenMDAO model, you have the option of choosing between these two options.\n",
    "Simple models will often just use one linear solver architecture at the top of the model hierarchy.\n",
    "More complex models might use both architectures at different parts of the hierarchy.\n",
    "At any level of the hierarchy, you can look at the aspects of the components contained within that group in order to\n",
    "figure out what kind of linear solver structure is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assembled-Jacobian Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "Using an assembled Jacobian means that OpenMDAO will explicitly allocate the memory for the entire\n",
    "Jacobian matrix up front, and then hold onto that and re-use it throughout the run.\n",
    "This has several computational advantages, but the major one is that it helps to reduce framework\n",
    "overhead for models with deep system hierarchies and large numbers of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should strongly consider using an assembled Jacobian if all the components in your model provide\n",
    "derivatives using the [compute_partials](../features/core_features/working_with_components/explicit_component.ipynb) or\n",
    "[linearize](../features/core_features/working_with_components/implicit_component.ipynb) methods.\n",
    "These methods are explicitly computing the elements of that Jacobian matrix, and so it makes sense\n",
    "to collect them into an actual matrix memory representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, if your model has a very large hierarchy (i.e. many levels, many components,\n",
    "many variables) then an assembled Jacobian will likely offer a significant performance advantage.\n",
    "The reason that large models benefit is that without the assembled Jacobian, OpenMDAO must\n",
    "recursively loop over each level of the hierarchy, each component, and each variable in order to\n",
    "compute Jacobian-vector products.\n",
    "That triple for-loop is rather expensive, and it's much more efficient to collect the Jacobian in a\n",
    "single chunk of memory if possible.\n",
    "So even if you are using an iterative linear solver, such as [ScipyKrylov](../features/building_blocks/solvers/scipy_iter_solver.ipynb) or [PetscKrylov](../features/building_blocks/solvers/petsc_krylov.ipynb), an assembled Jacobian is generally more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "If you want to see how to add an assembled Jacobian to your model, check out [this feature doc](../features/core_features/working_with_derivatives/assembled_jacobian.ipynb).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sparse Assembled Jacobian\n",
    "\n",
    "In the majority of cases, if an assembled Jacobian is appropriate for your model, then you want to\n",
    "use the [CSCJacobian](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/blob/master/openmdao/jacobians/assembled_jacobian.py).\n",
    "The [CSCJacobian](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/OpenMDAO/blob/master/openmdao/jacobians/assembled_jacobian.py) only allocates memory for the nonzero partial derivatives. How does OpenMDAO know which partials are nonzero?\n",
    "The authors of the components in your model declared them using either a\n",
    "[dense](../features/core_features/working_with_derivatives/specifying_partials.ipynb) or form of `declare_partials`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if all of your components declared their partial derivatives as dense (or if they are all\n",
    "scalar variables and specifying sparsity doesn't have meaning), at the group level there is still a\n",
    "sparsity pattern to be taken advantage of.\n",
    "This sparsity arises from the way components are connected to one another, because unless there is\n",
    "a connection present, there is no need to allocate space associated with that portion of the Jacobian.\n",
    "We can see this clearly by looking at a collapsed form of the $N^2$ diagram with just the outputs shown.\n",
    "There are 7 scalar outputs, so we have a $7 \\times 7$ partial derivative Jacobian.\n",
    "Out of the possible 49 matrix entries, only 18 are actually nonzero. That makes it 63% sparse. Sellar is only a\n",
    "tiny toy problem, but in a real problem with thousands of variables, you will more commonly see sparsity percentages of over 90%."
