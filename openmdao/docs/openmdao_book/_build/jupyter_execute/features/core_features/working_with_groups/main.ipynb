    "# Working with Groups\n",
    "\n",
    "Itâ€™s often desirable to represent a complex model as a collection of components. Using Group objects, we can group components, as well as other Groups, together to form a tree structure. The following sections explain how to create that tree structure, how to access subsystems and variables within the tree, and how to connect those variables. They will also explain how to promote a variable from a subsystem up to its parent Group.\n",
