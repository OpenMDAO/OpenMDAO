    "\n",
    "When complex step is used somewhere in an OpenMDAO model, OpenMDAO must allocate sufficient memory to\n",
    "contain a complex version of the nonlinear vector, and in many cases also a complex version of the\n",
    "linear vector.  OpenMDAO can figure this out automatically most of the time.  For example, if any \n",
    "component in your model calls either `declare_partials` or `declare_coloring` with `method='cs'`,\n",
    "complex vectors will be allocated automatically.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The main situation where complex vectors are \n",
    "needed but are *not* allocated automatically is when you call either `check_totals` or `check_partials`\n",
    "with `method='cs'` and nothing in your model natively uses complex step.  In that case, you must\n",
    "tell OpenMDAO that complex vectors are required by passing a `force_alloc_complex=True` argument\n",
    "when calling `setup` on your `Problem`.  The `force_alloc_complex` flag will force OpenMDAO to \n",
    "allocate complex nonlinear vectors regardless of what it detects in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that while `ExecComp` components use complex step to compute derivatives by default, they do not \n",
    "require that the OpenMDAO nonlinear vectors are complex because they perform their own internal\n",
    "complex step operation.  However, if you declare your own partials on an `ExecComp` using \n",
    "`declare_partials` or `declare_coloring` with `method='cs'`, then that component will use the\n",
