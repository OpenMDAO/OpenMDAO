Instead of defining an explicit equation for the output, `residuals['example_output']` defines an equation for the residual *associated with* the output (state variable) `example_output`.

In fact, for the `Node` component, it is not even possible to define a `solve_nonlinear` because *V* does not show up directly in the residual function.
