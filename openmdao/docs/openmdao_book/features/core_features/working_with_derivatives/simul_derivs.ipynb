    "# Simultaneous Total Derivative Coloring For Separable Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "When OpenMDAO solves for total derivatives, it loops over either design variables in ‘fwd’ mode or responses in ‘rev’ mode. For each of those variables, it performs a linear solve for each member of that variable, so for a scalar variable there would be only a single linear solve, and there would be N solves for an array variable of size N.\n",
    "\n",
    "Certain problems have a special kind of sparsity structure in the total derivative Jacobian that allows OpenMDAO to solve for multiple derivatives simultaneously. This can result in far fewer linear solves and much-improved performance. These problems are said to have separable variables. The concept of separability is explained in the [Theory Manual](../../../theory_manual/advanced_linear_solvers_special_cases/separable).\n",
    "\n",
    "Simultaneous derivative coloring in OpenMDAO can be performed either statically or dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "When mode is set to ‘fwd’ or ‘rev’, a unidirectional coloring algorithm is used to group columns or rows, respectively, for simultaneous derivative calculation. The algorithm used in this case is the greedy algorithm with ordering by incidence degree found in T. F. Coleman and J. J. More, *Estimation of sparse Jacobian matrices and graph coloring problems*, SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 20 (1983), pp. 187–209.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using simultaneous derivatives, setting `mode=’auto’` will indicate that bidirectional coloring should be used. Bidirectional coloring can significantly decrease the number of linear solves needed to generate the total Jacobian relative to coloring only in fwd or rev mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on the bidirectional coloring algorithm, see T. F. Coleman and A. Verma, *The efficient computation of sparse Jacobian matrices using automatic differentiation*, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 19 (1998), pp. 1210–1233."

    "## Dynamic Coloring\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic coloring computes the derivative colors at runtime, shortly after the driver begins the optimization. This has the advantage of simplicity and robustness to changes in the model, but adds the cost of the coloring computation to the run time of the optimization. Generally, however, this cost will be small relative to the cost of the full optimization unless your total jacobian is very large.\n",
    "\n",
    "Activating dynamic coloring is simple. Just call the `declare_coloring` function on the driver. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    prob.driver.declare_coloring()\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to change the number of `compute_totals` calls that the coloring algorithm uses to compute the Jacobian sparsity (default is 3), the tolerance used to determine nonzeros (default is 1e-25), you can pass the `num_full_jacs`, and `tol` args. You can also pass the `min_improve_pct` arg, which specifies how much the coloring must reduce the number of linear solves required to generate the total Jacobian else coloring will be deactivated.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    prob.driver.declare_coloring(num_full_jacs=2, tol=1e-20, min_improve_pct=10.)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to perform a tolerance sweep, trying out a range of tolerances when determining what values of the sparsity matrix should be considered zero, then you can set the `orders` arg. OpenMDAO will then sweep over tolerances from the given `tol` plus and minus `orders` orders of magnitude. For each tolerance, it checks the number of nonzero values, and chooses a tolerance from the largest group of tolerances that share the same number of nonzeros. If it can’t find at least two tolerances that result in the same number of nonzeros, an exception is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s an example:\n",

    "    prob.driver.declare_coloring(tol=1e-35, orders=20)\n",

    "Whenever a dynamic coloring is computed, the coloring is written to a file called *total_coloring.pkl* for later ‘static’ use. The file will be written in a directory specified in `problem.options['coloring_dir']`. If no value is set into `problem.options['coloring_dir']` then the *coloring_files* directory under the current working directory at the time the problem is instantiated will be used.\n",
