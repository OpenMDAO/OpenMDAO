    "# Connections involving distributed variables\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this section is to describe the behavior you should expect when connecting two variables together when at least one of them is a distributed variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Distributed output to non-distributed input\n",
    "Because distributed variables may have different sizes and/or values on different ranks, and non-distributed variables have the same value and size on all ranks, the only way that a distributed to non-distributed connection is allowed is if `src_indices` are specified for the non-distributed input and that the specified `src_indices` are identical on all ranks where the input variable exists.  Otherwise the non-distributed inputs could have different values on different ranks, which is illegal. Note that in previous versions of OpenMDAO, the behavior when connecting a distributed output to a non-distributed input when `src_indices` were not specified was that the non-distributed input on each rank would be the same size as the full distributed output.  This is no longer the case.  In fact, this case is no longer allowed.  However, you can still achieve the same behavior by specifying `src_indices` of `om.slicer[:]` on the input, which explicitly specifies that the input on each rank is the same size as the full distributed output.  For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "group.connect('mydistcomp.out', 'mynondistributed.in', src_indices=om.slicer[:])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Distributed output to distributed input\n",
    "When connecting two distributed variables, you can specify `src_indices` on the input however you choose, or OpenMDAO will automatically assign `src_indices` to the input based on the size of the input in each rank.  For example, if the component that owns the input is running on 3 ranks with input sizes of [2, 3, 4], then `src_indices` of [0, 1], [2, 3, 4], and [5, 6, 7, 8] will be specified on the 3 ranks.  If, however, the global size of the output does not equal the global size of the input, an exception will be raised saying that OpenMDAO is not able to determine the `src_indices`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Non-distributed output to distributed input\n",
    "These types of connections are deprecated and will become errors in a future release, but for now, you are allowed to connect a non-distributed output to a distributed input, provided that the global sizes of input and output are equal and the inputs are the same size on every rank.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "The following example shows the `MixedDistrib2` component, which contains a non-distributed input, a distributed input, and a distributed output. We show how to connect the non-distributed input and the distributed input to a distributed output."
