    "# Instance-based Profiling\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has several good profilers available for general python code, and instance-based profiling is not meant to replace general profiling. However, because the OpenMDAO profiler lets you view the profiled functions grouped by the specific `Problem`, `System`, `Group`, `Driver`, or `Solver` that called them, it can provide insight into which parts of your model are more expensive, even when different parts of your model use many of the same underlying functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instance-based profiling by default will record information for all calls to any of the main OpenMDAO classes or their descendants, for example, `System`, `Problem`, `Solver`, `Driver`, `Matrix` and `Jacobian`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to use instance-based profiling is via the command line using the `openmdao iprof` command. For example:\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "    openmdao iprof <your_python_script_here>\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will collect the profiling data, start a web server, and pop up an icicle viewer in a web browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally it’s best to just use all of the defaults, but if necessary you can change the server port number using the -*p* option, or change the title of the displayed page using the -*t* option, for example:\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "    openmdao iprof <your_python_script_here> -p 8801 -t \"Instance Profile for propulsor.py\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "You should then see something like this:\n",
    "![An example of a profile icicle viewer](profile_icicle.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the viewer, hovering over a box will show the function pathname, the local and total elapsed time for that function, and the local and total number of calls for that function. Clicking on a box will collapse the view so that that box’s function will become the top box and only functions called by that function will be visible. The top box before any box has been collapsed is called *$total* and does not represent a real function. Instead, it shows the total time that profiling was active. If there are gaps below a parent block, i.e. its child blocks don’t cover the entire space below the parent, that gap represents the time exclusive to the parent or time taken up by functions called by the parent that are not being profiled.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a *Reset* button that will take you back to the top level of the profile after you have clicked down into a sub-call.\n",
    "\n",
    "Documentation of options for all commands described here can be obtained by running the command followed by the -h option. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "    openmdao iprof -h\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "usage: openmdao iprof [-h] [-p PORT] [--no_browser] [-t TITLE] [-g METHODS] [-m MAXCALLS] file [file ...]\n",
    "\n",
    "positional arguments:\n",
    "  file                  Raw profile data files or a python file.\n",
    "\n",
    "optional arguments:\n",
    "  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n",
    "  -p PORT, --port PORT  port used for web server\n",
    "  --no_browser          Don't pop up a browser to view the data.\n",
    "  -t TITLE, --title TITLE\n",
    "                        Title to be displayed above profiling view.\n",
    "  -g METHODS, --group METHODS\n",
    "                        Determines which group of methods will be tracked. Current options are: ['coloring', 'dataflow', 'driver',\n",
    "                        'jac', 'linear', 'openmdao', 'openmdao_all', 'setup', 'solver', 'transfer'] and \"openmdao\" is the default\n",
    "  -m MAXCALLS, --maxcalls MAXCALLS\n",
    "                        Maximum number of calls displayed at one time. Default=15000.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you just want to see the timing totals for each method, you can call `openmdao iprof_totals` instead of `openmdao iprof`. For example:\n",
