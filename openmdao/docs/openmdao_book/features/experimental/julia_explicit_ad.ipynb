    "# What is Julia?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Julia](https://julialang.org/) is a new-ish programming language targeting scientific and high-performance computing applications.\n",
    "Like Python or MATLAB, it is a dynamic language—you don't need to declare the types of variables like you would in C, C++, Fortran, etc..\n",
    "Unlike Python, it is a compiled language, as every function is compiled to machine code the first time it is called.\n",
    "The aim of Julia is to provide users with a programming language that combines the convience of Python or MATLAB with the speed of C or Fortran.\n",
    "The [official Julia documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/) has [a nice page comparing Julia to other popular languages](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/noteworthy-differences/) if you'd like to know more.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most attractive features of Julia for OpenMDAO users is its good support for automatic differentiation (AD).\n",
    "There are many (perhaps too many!) AD libraries available for the language, all with particular strengths and weaknesses.\n",
    "Happily, an excellent library called [DifferentiationInterface.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/DifferentiationInterface.jl) exists which allows us to use any of these numerious AD library via a uniform API, which makes switching from one to another a matter of changing just one or two lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "# What is OpenMDAO.jl?\n",
    "[OpenMDAO.jl](https://github.com/byuflowlab/OpenMDAO.jl) is a Python+Julia software package that allows users to create OpenMDAO `Component`s out of Julia code, and optionally use a Julia AD package to differentiate the `Component`.\n",
    "There are currently two possible approaches to using AD with Julia:\n",
    "1. Manual Approach: Users can write the equivalent of a `compute_partials` or `linearize` method in Julia that calls the desired AD library manually. This is quite flexible and conceptually straightforward, but requires more work on the part of the user to manage the complexities of translating the `inputs` and `outputs` vectors OpenMDAO provides to something that the AD library can work with.\n",
    "2. Automatic Approach: Users can write a relatively simple \"callback function\" that implements the math behind the `Component` they wish to create, and allow OpenMDAO.jl to call the AD for them. This is much less work for the user, but does require learning a bit more about the Julia language. This approach is also currently limited to creating `ExplicitComponent`s (though the callback function can contain implicitness via the [ImplicitAD.jl](https://github.com/byuflowlab/ImplicitAD.jl) package).\n",
    "\n",
    "This documentation will focus on approach number 2, the Automatic Approach, which consists of essentially three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a user-defined callback function\n",
    "2. Create an OpenMDAO.jl `AbstractADExplicitComp` `struct` that will keep track the user-defined function, the desired AD library, and other optional features like units, tags, etc..\n",
    "3. Pass the `AbstractADExplicitComp` to omjlcomps (\"OpenMDAO Julia Components\"), a Python library that knows how to create OpenMDAO `Component`s from an OpenMDAO.jl `AbstractADExplicitComp`.\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing those three steps, you'll be left with an OpenMDAO `Component` that you can include anywhere in an OpenMDAO model.\n",
    "We'll go through each of the three steps below. \n",
    "For more details, have a look at the [OpenMDAO.jl docs](https://flow.byu.edu/OpenMDAO.jl/dev/)."

    "## Step 1: The User-Defined Function\n",
    "The user-defined function *must* follow one of two forms: either it can be an \"in-place\" function that writes its outputs to an output vector, or it can be an \"out-of-place\" function that returns a single output vector.\n",
    "The function must be written in Julia, of course, and anything that happens inside the function is up to you, of course.\n",
    "Both the in-place and out-of-place form must also have a `params` argument that will contain inputs that are needed for the calculation, but won't be differentiated (the equivalent of OpenMDAO `options`).\n",
    "So, an example of an in-place function would be\n",
    "\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "function f_in_place!(Y, X, params)\n",
    "   # calculate stuff with X and params, storing result in Y\n",
    "   return nothing\n",
    "end\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where `X` is the input vector and `Y` is the output vector.\n",
    "(The function doesn't have to return `nothing`, but any returned value will be ignored, so I like to include `return nothing` to make it clear that the return value doesn't matter.)\n",
    "An out-of-place function would look like\n",
    "\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "function f_out_of_place(X, params)\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where again `X` is the input vector and `Y` is the output vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the `X` and `Y` arguments of those functions must not be plain Julia `Vector`s, but `ComponentVectors` from the [ComponentArrays.jl](https://github.com/jonniedie/ComponentArrays.jl) package.\n",
    "What are those?\n",
    "They are objects provided by the [ComponentArrays.jl](https://github.com/SciML/ComponentArrays.jl) package that act like `Vector`s, but allow the user to define names for each part (\"component\") of the vector.\n",

In this example everything is a scalar, so no allocations would have happened anyway. But it doesn't hurt to use `@view`: it's a good habit to get into, and it allows us to use the `@.` broadcasting macro with the scalar `f_xy` output.\n",

    "* We used the `DenseADExplicitComp` `struct` to create our Paraboloid component, which is the most appropriate for a component with a dense Jacobian. But OpenMDAO.jl can also create components that evaluate the derivatives using the [matrix-free approach](https://flow.byu.edu/OpenMDAO.jl/dev/matrix_free_ad/), or [accelerate the calculation of sparse Jacobians using coloring algorithms](https://flow.byu.edu/OpenMDAO.jl/dev/auto_sparse_ad/).\n",
    "* The OpenMDAO.jl docs also have [recommendations on how to create Python packages that contain Julia OpenMDAO components](https://flow.byu.edu/OpenMDAO.jl/dev/creating_python_packages/) that you should definitely check out if you plan on using OpenMDAO.jl for \"real work.\" There is also an example Python package that follows these guidelines in the GitHub repository.\n",
    "* In the aformentioned example Python package in the OpenMDAO.jl GitHub repository there is an example of using OpenMDAO.jl and [ImplicitAD.jl](https://github.com/byuflowlab/ImplicitAD.jl) to solve [the nonlinear circuit example from the OpenMDAO docs](../../advanced_user_guide/models_implicit_components/models_with_solvers_implicit). This shows how we can use OpenMDAO.jl to efficiently differentiate through an implicit calculation with a little help from ImplicitAD.jl."
