    "# Determining Variable Shapes at Runtime\n",
    "\n",
    "It's sometimes useful to create a component where the shapes of its inputs and/or outputs are\n",
    "determined by their connections.  This allows us to create components representing general\n",
    "purpose vector or matrix operations such as norms, summations, integrators, etc., that size\n",
    "themselves appropriately based on the model that they're added to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Turning on dynamic shape computation is straightforward.  You just specify `shape_by_conn`\n",
    "and/or `copy_shape` in your `add_input` or `add_output` calls when you add variables\n",
    "to your component.\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting `shape_by_conn=True` when adding an input or output variable will allow the shape\n",
    "of that variable to be determined at runtime based on the variable that connects to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting `copy_shape=<var_name>`, where `<var_name>` is the local name of another variable in your\n",
    "component, will take the shape of the variable specified in `<var_name>` and use that\n",
    "shape for the variable you're adding.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that `shape_by_conn` can be specified for outputs as well as for inputs, as can `copy_shape`.\n",
    "This means that shape information can propagate through the model in either forward or reverse. If\n",
    "you specify both `shape_by_conn` and `copy_shape` for your component's dynamically shaped variables, \n",
    "it will allow your their shapes to be resolved whether known shapes have been defined upstream or \n",
    "downstream of your component in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following component with input `x` and output `y` can have its shapes set by known shapes \n",
    "that are either upstream or downstream. Note that this component also has sparse partials, diagonal in this case, \n",
    "and those are specified within the `setup_partials` method which is called after all shapes have been computed.\n",
    "It uses the `_get_var_meta` method to get the size of its variables in order to determine the size\n",
    "of the partials.\n"
