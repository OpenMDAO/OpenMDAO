    "# Determining Variable Shapes at Runtime\n",
    "\n",
    "It's sometimes useful to create a component where the shapes of its inputs and/or outputs are\n",
    "determined by their connections.  This allows us to create components representing general\n",
    "purpose vector or matrix operations such as norms, summations, integrators, etc., that size\n",
    "themselves appropriately based on the model that they're added to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Turning on dynamic shape computation is straightforward.  You just specify `shape_by_conn`, `copy_shape`\n",
    "and/or `compute_shape` in your `add_input` or `add_output` calls when you add variables\n",
    "to your component.\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting `shape_by_conn=True` when adding an input or output variable will allow the shape\n",
    "of that variable to be determined at runtime based on the variable that connects to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting `copy_shape=<var_name>`, where `<var_name>` is the local name of another variable in your\n",
    "component, will take the shape of the variable specified in `<var_name>` and use that\n",
    "shape for the variable you're adding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting `compute_shape=<func>`, where `<func>` is a function taking a dict arg that maps variable\n",
    "names to shapes and returning the computed shape, will set the shape of the variable you're adding\n",
    "as a function of the other variables in the same component of the opposite io type.  For example,\n",
    "setting `compute_shape` for an output `z` on a component with inputs `x` and `y`, would cause the\n",
    "supplied function to be called with a dict of the form {`x`: <shape of x>, `y`: <shape of y>}, so\n",
    "the computed shape of `z` could be a function of the shapes of `x` and `y`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that `shape_by_conn` can be specified for outputs as well as for inputs, as can `copy_shape`\n",
    "and `compute_shape`.\n",
    "This means that shape information can propagate through the model in either forward or reverse. If\n",
    "you specify both `shape_by_conn` and either `copy_shape` or `compute_shape` for your component's \n",
    "dynamically shaped variables, it will allow their shapes to be resolved whether known shapes have \n",
    "been defined upstream or downstream of your component in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following component with input `x` and output `y` can have its shapes set by known shapes \n",
