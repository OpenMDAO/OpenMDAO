    "\n",
    "What if you've developed an OpenMDAO-related python package and would like anyone using that package\n",
    "to have access to a new report type that you've defined within that package?  You can do this by\n",
    "creating an `openmdao_report` plugin using the steps outlined below.  This example will use the\n",
    "existing `summary` report plugin as an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Create the function that generates your report. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    def _summary_report(prob):\n",
    "        path = str(pathlib.Path(prob.get_reports_dir()).joinpath('summary.html'))\n",
    "        s = StringIO()\n",

    "            f.write(text2html(s.getvalue()))\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    Note that your report function must take as an argument an instance of the type that contains the\n",
    "    method where your report is registered to run.  For example, in the `register_report` call below,\n",
    "    it refers to the `final_setup` method of `Problem`, so our instance in this case must be an \n",
    "    instance of `Problem`.  Also, note that the function calls `prob.get_reports_dir()` to get the\n",
    "    location of the reports directory where the report shouild be written.  In addition, the\n",
    "    string generated from calling `config_summary` is plain text, so it is wrapped in html using the\n",
    "    `text2html` function to make it easily viewable in a browser, and therefore accessible using the\n",
    "    `openmdao view_reports` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Create a function that will register your new report type.  For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    def _summary_report_register():\n",
    "        register_report('summary', _summary_report, 'Model summary', 'Problem', 'final_setup', 'post')\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    The call above will result in a report type called `summary` that triggers at the end of\n",
    "    `Problem.final_setup`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Create an entry point in your package's `setup.py` file.  In this example, our report\n",
    "registry function is found in the `openmdao.devtools.debug.py` file, so we'll update the \n",
