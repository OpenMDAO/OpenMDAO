    "# Quick Reference: OpenMDAO-Related Environment Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, the way in which OpenMDAO operates is up to the preferences of the user.\n",
    "At this time, rather than using a preferences file, these optional OpenMDAO behaviors are based on the values of environment variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these environment variables are interpreted as either being \"truthy\" or \"falsey\".\n",
    "For OpenMDAO, an environment variable is considered `False` if it takes on one of the following values:\n",
    "- '0'\n",
    "- 'false'\n",
    "- 'no'\n",
    "- 'off'\n",
    "- 'none'\n",
    "- ''\n",
    "\n",
    "These are all string values and OpenMDAO interprets them in a case-insensitive way.\n",
    "Note that, for OpenMDAO, the empty string means that an unset environment variable will be interpreted as `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Any other environment variable value other than those above is interpreted as `True`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## User-Facing Environment Variables\n",
