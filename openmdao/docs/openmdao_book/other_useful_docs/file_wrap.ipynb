    "## Communicating with External Codes in OpenMDAO\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The [ExternalCodeComp](../features/building_blocks/components/external_code_comp.ipynb) example describes how to\n",
    "define a component that calls an external program to perform its computation,\n",
    "passing input and output values via files.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input and output files were very simple in that basic example, containing only\n",
    "the values of interest.  In the general case however, you will probably need to\n",
    "generate an input file (with a specific format of rows and fields), and you'll also need to parse a\n",
    "similarly-formatted output file to get the output values. To facilitate working\n",
    "with these more complex input and output files, OpenMDAO provides a couple of utility\n",
    "classes: `InputFileGenerator` and `FileParser`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Generating the Input File\n",
    "\n",
    "You can generate an input file for an external application in a few different ways.\n",
    "One way is to write the file completely from scratch using the new values that are\n",
    "contained in the component's variables. Not much can be done to aid with this task, as\n",
    "it requires knowledge of the file format and can be completed using Python's standard\n",
    "formatted output.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second way to generate an input file is by templating. A *template* file is\n",
    "a sample input file which can be processed by a templating engine to insert\n",
    "new values in the appropriate locations. Often the template file is a valid\n",
    "input file before being processed, although other times it contains directives\n",
    "or conditional logic to guide the generation. Obviously this method works well\n",
    "for cases where only a small number of the possible variables and settings are\n",
    "being manipulated.\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenMDAO includes a basic templating capability that allows a template file to\n",
    "be read, fields to be replaced with new values, and an input file to be\n",
    "generated so that the external application can read it. Suppose you have an\n",
    "input file that contains some integer, floating point, and string inputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    INPUT\n",
    "    1 2 3\n",
    "    INPUT\n",
    "    10.1 20.2 30.3\n",
    "    A B C\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a valid input file for your application, and it can also be used as a\n",
    "template file. The templating object is called `InputFileGenerator`, and it\n",
    "includes methods that can replace specific fields as measured by their row\n",
    "and field numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the InputFileGenerator, first instantiate it and give it the name of\n",
    "the template file and the name of the output file that you want to produce. (Note\n",
    "that this code must be placed in the ``compute`` method of your component *before*\n",
    "the external code is run.) The code will generally look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "from openmdao.utils.file_wrap import InputFileGenerator\n",
    "\n",
    "parser = InputFileGenerator()\n",
    "parser.set_template_file('mytemplate.txt')\n",
    "parser.set_generated_file('myinput.txt')\n",
    "\n",
    "# (Call functions to poke new values here)\n",
    "\n",
    "parser.generate()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When the template file is set, it is read into memory so that all subsequent\n",
    "replacements are done without writing the intermediate file to the disk. Once\n",
    "all replacements have been made, the `generate` method is called to create the\n",
    "input file.  If you have not provided the name of an output file, then the\n",
    "generated file data will be returned as a string.  We will use this feature in\n",
    "the following examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you want to replace the second integer in the input file above\n",
    "with a 7. The code would look like this."
