Release Notes for OpenMDAO 2.1.0
December 1, 2017

New Features:
-------------
- Configure setup hook allowing changing of solver settings after hierarchy tree is instantiated
- Component metadata system for specifying init_args with error checking
- Parallel Groups
- Units Reference added to the Docs
- Case recording now records all variables by default
- `openmdao` console script that can activate useful debugging features
  (e.g. view_model) without editing the run script
- Scipy COBYLA optimizer converts des var bounds to constraints (the algorithm doesn't natively handle bounds)
- StructuredMetaModel component offers a simple spline interpolation routine for structured data

Backwards Compatible API Changes:
-----------------------------------
- `NonlinearRunOnce` changed `NonLinearRunOnce` for consistency (old class deprecated)
- `types_` argument to `self.metadata.declare` changed to `types`. (old argument deprecated)
- `types` and `values` arguments to `self.metadata.declare`
-  `BalanceComp` has a `use_mult` argument to control if it has a `mult` input, defaulting to false
   (the mult input isn't used most of the time)
- Renamed `MetaModel` to `UnstructuredMetaModel` and `MultiFiMetaModel` to `UnStructuredMultiFiMetaModel`



Backwards Incompatible API changes:
-----------------------------------
- Case Recording options API updated with `.recording_options` attribute on Driver, Solver, and System classes
- `get_subsystem` changed to a private method, removed from public API of System
- `check_partials` now has a `method` argument that controls which type of check

Bug Fixes:
-----------
- Improved error msg on a corner case for when user doesn't declare a partial derivative
- Fixed docs embedding bug when `<>` included in the output text
