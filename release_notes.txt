Release Notes for OpenMDAO 2.2.0

February 9, 2018

New Features:
--------------
- `DirectSolver` now tells you which row or column is singular when it gets a singluar matrix error.
- `ScipyOptimizeDriver` now handles linear constraints more efficiently by only computing them one time.
- Added the `openmdao` command line script to allow for model checking, visualization, and profiling without making modifications to the run script.
- Added a `SimpleGADriver` with a basic genetic algorithm implementation.
- Added a `MetaModelStructured` component with a interpolative method.
- New option for derivative calculations: Simultaneous derivatives, useful when you have totally disjoint Jacobians (e.g. diagonal Jacobians).
- Automatic coloring algorithm added to compute the valid coloring scheme for simultaneous derivatives.
- `list_outputs` method updated with new display options, ability to filter variables by residual value, ability to change sorting scheme, and ability to display unit details.
- openmdao citation helper added to the `openmdao` command line script, making it easy to generate the correct bibtex citations based on which classes are being used.
- `NewtonSolver` modified so that maxiter=0 case now will compute residuals, but not do a linear solve (useful for debugging nonlinear errors).

Backwards-Compatible API Changes:
-----------------------------------
- Changed `ScipyOptimizer` to `ScipyOptimizeDriver` for consistency (deprecated older class).
- Renamed `MetaModel` to `MetaModelUnstructured` to allow for new structured interpolant (deprecated old class).
- Renamed `PetscKSP` to `PETScKrylov` for consistency. (deprecated old class).
- Renamed `ScipyIterativeSolver` to `ScipyKrylov` for consistency. (deprecated old class).


Backwards-Incompatible API changes:
-----------------------------------
- CaseRecorder now uses variables' promoted names for storing and accessing data.
- Removed `DeprecatedComp` from codebase.
- `list_residuals` method on Groups and Components removed.

Bug Fixes:
-----------
- Fixed error check for duplicate connections to a single input from multiple levels of the hierarchy

Release Notes for OpenMDAO 2.1.0

December 7, 2017

New Features:
-------------
- Configure setup hook allowing changing of solver settings after hierarchy tree is instantiated
- Component metadata system for specifying init_args with error checking
- Parallel Groups
- Units Reference added to the Docs
- Case recording now records all variables by default
- `openmdao` console script that can activate useful debugging features
  (e.g. view_model) without editing the run script
- Scipy COBYLA optimizer converts des var bounds to constraints (the algorithm doesn't natively handle bounds)
- StructuredMetaModel component offers a simple spline interpolation routine for structured data

Backwards Compatible API Changes:
-----------------------------------
- `NonlinearRunOnce` changed `NonLinearRunOnce` for consistency (old class deprecated)
- `types_` argument to `self.metadata.declare` changed to `types`. (old argument deprecated)
- `types` and `values` arguments to `self.metadata.declare`
-  `BalanceComp` has a `use_mult` argument to control if it has a `mult` input, defaulting to false
   (the mult input isn't used most of the time)
- Renamed `MetaModel` to `UnstructuredMetaModel` and `MultiFiMetaModel` to `UnStructuredMultiFiMetaModel`


Backwards Incompatible API changes:
-----------------------------------
- Case Recording options API updated with `.recording_options` attribute on Driver, Solver, and System classes
- `get_subsystem` changed to a private method, removed from public API of System
- `check_partials` now has a `method` argument that controls which type of check

Bug Fixes:
-----------
- Improved error msg on a corner case for when user doesn't declare a partial derivative
- Fixed docs embedding bug when `<>` included in the output text
